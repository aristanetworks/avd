"""
This module provides Pydantic models (classes) representing the meta-schema of the AVD Schema.

Each variable in the schema is called a field, and for each type of field we have a corrosponding Pydantic model:
- AvdSchemaInt
- AvdSchemaBool
- AvdSchemaStr
- AvdSchemaList
- AvdSchemaDict

The alias "AvdSchemaField" is a union of of all the models above, and can be used as easy type hint for any field type.

All the type-specific Pydantic models inherit the common base class "AvdSchemaBaseModel", and have local overrides
as needed. For example, only "AvdSchemaList" and "AvdSchemaDict" need to parse child fields.

The overall schema is covered by the class "AristaAvdSchema" which inherits from "AvdSchemaDict" since the root of the schema is a dict.
