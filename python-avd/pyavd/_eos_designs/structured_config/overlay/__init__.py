    The AvdStructuredConfig Class is imported used "get_structured_config" to render parts of the structured config.

    "get_structured_config" imports, instantiates and run the .render() method on the class.
    .render() runs all class methods not starting with _ and of type @cached property and inserts the returned data into
    a dict with the name of the method as key. This means that each key in the final dict corresponds to a method.

    The Class uses AvdFacts, as the base class, to get the render, keys and other attributes.
    All other methods are included as "Mixins" to make the files more manageable.

    The order of the @cached_properties methods imported from Mixins will also control the order in the output.
