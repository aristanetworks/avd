            ipsec_key_salt:

              required: true
              description: |-
                "Salt" used for auto generation of encryption keys for IPsec tunnels to Zscaler.
                The keys will be generated as a hash of `salt_<hostname>_<policy_name>`.
                Since this salt can be used to deduct the encryption key, it is recommended to use vault.
            domain_name:
              type: str
              required: true
              description: Domain name as configured in Zscaler for the tenant. Used as UFQDN suffix for authentication.

              description: |-
                When `true` the traffic going over the tunnels will be encrypted with AES-256-GCM. Otherwise the traffic will be using NULL encryption.
                Note that encryption requires a subscription on the Zscaler account.
