      General Configuration required for EVPN Multicast. "evpn_l2_multicast" or "evpn_l3_multicast" must also be configured under the Network Services (tenants).
      Requires "underlay_multicast: true" and IGMP snooping enabled globally (default).
      For MLAG devices Route Distinguisher must be unique since this feature will create multi-vtep configuration.
      Warning !!! For Trident3 based platforms i.e 7050X3, 7300X3, 720XP.
        The Following default platform setting will be configured on 7050X3 and 7300X3: "platform trident forwarding-table partition flexible exact-match 16384 l2-shared 98304 l3-shared 131072"
        The Following default platform setting will be configured on 720XP: "flexible exact-match 16000 l2-shared 18000 l3-shared 22000"
        All forwarding agents will be restarted when this configuration is applied.
        You can tune the settings by overriding the default variable: "platform_settings[platforms].trident_forwarding_table_partition:"
        Please contact an Arista representative for help with determining the appropriate values for your environment.
    default: false
