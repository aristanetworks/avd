      sFlow settings.
      The sFlow process will only be configured if any interface is enabled for sFlow.
      For default enabling of sFlow for various interface types across the fabric see `fabric_sflow`.

              Packet sampling rate that defines the average number of ingress packets that pass through an interface for every packet that is sampled.
              A rate of 16384 corresponds to an average sample of one per 16384 packets.

                If not set, the VRF is automatically picked up from the global setting `default_mgmt_method`.
                The value of `vrf` will be interpreted according to these rules:
                - `use_mgmt_interface_vrf` will configure the sFlow destination under the VRF set with `mgmt_interface_vrf` and set the `mgmt_interface` as sFlow source-interface.
                  An error will be raised if `mgmt_ip` or `ipv6_mgmt_ip` are not configured for the device.
                - `use_inband_mgmt_vrf` will configure the sFlow destination under the VRF set with `inband_mgmt_vrf` and set the `inband_mgmt_interface` as sFlow source-interface.
                  An error will be raised if inband management is not configured for the device.
                - Any other string will be used directly as the VRF name. Remember to set the `sflow_settings.vrfs[].source_interface` if needed.

                If set for the VRFs defined by `mgmt_interface_vrf` or `inband_mgmt_vrf`, this setting will take precedence.
