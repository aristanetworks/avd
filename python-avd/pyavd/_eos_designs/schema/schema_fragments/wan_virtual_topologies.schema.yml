                It is possible to overwrite the default policy for all VRFs using it

                Required for VRFs carried over AutoVPN or CV Pathfinder WAN.

                A VRF can have different VNIs between the Datacenters and the WAN.
                Note that if no VRF default is configured for WAN, AVD will automatically inject the VRF default with
                `wan_vni` set to `1`.
                In addition either `vrf_id` or `vrf_vni` must be set to enforce consistent route-targets across domains.

          are used in the generated load-balance policy.
          ID is hardcoded to 254 for the AVT profile in CV Pathfinder mode.

              If not overwritten elsewhere, the application profile is generated matching one application matching the control plane traffic either sourced from or destined to the WAN route servers.

          List of virtual toplogies policies.

          For AutoVPN, each item in the list creates:
            * one policy with:
                * one `match` entry per `application_virtual_topologies` item
                  they are indexed using `10 * <list_index>` where `list_index` starts at `1`.
                * one `default-match`
            * one load-balance policy per `application_virtual_topologies` and one for the `default_virtual_topology`.
            * if the policy is associated with the default VRF, a special control-plane rule is injected
              in the policy with index `1` referring to a control-plane load-balance policy as defined under
              `control_plane_virtual_topology` or if not set, the default one.

          For CV Pathfinder, each item in the list creates:
            * one policy with:
                * one `match` entry per `application_virtual_topologies` item ordered as in the data.
                * one last match entry for the `default` application-profile using `default_virtual_topology` information.
            * one profile per `application_virtual_topologies` item.
            * one profile for the `default_virtual_topology`.
            * one load-balance policy per `application_virtual_topologies`.
            * one load_balance policy for the `default_virtual_topology`.
            * if the policy is associated with the default VRF, a special control-plane profile is configured
              and injected first in the policy assigned to the `default` VRF. This profile points to a
              control-plane load-balance policy as defined under `control_plane_virtual_topology` or if not set, the default one.
