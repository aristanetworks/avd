      - It is possible to provision configurations for a complete topology but flag devices as undeployed using the host level variable `is_deployed: false`.

      ```yaml
      # Use at the host level
      is_deployed: < true or false or default -> true >
      ```

      - By default, this will have no impact within the `eos_designs` role. Configs will still be generated by the `eos_cli_config_gen` role and will still be pushed by the `eos_config_deploy_eapi` directly to devices if used.
      - However, if the `eos_config_deploy_cvp` role is used to push configurations, CloudVision will ignore the devices flagged  as `is_deployed: false` and not attempt to configure them.
      - If the device is not present in the network due to CloudVision not configuring the device, `eos_validate_state` role will fail tests on peers of the undeployed device trying to verify that interfaces are up.
      - To overcome this and shutdown interfaces towards undeployed peers, the variable `shutdown_interfaces_towards_undeployed_peers` can be used, satisfying the `eos_validate_state` role interface tests.
      - Again, this is only an issue if `eos_config_deploy_cvp` is used and the devices are not present in the network.
