      PREVIEW: These keys are in preview mode.

      Special data model used for testing the WAN internet-exit integration with Zscaler.
      The model is supposed to be autofilled per-device by `eos_designs`.
      Manually setting this model will take precedence and prevent `eos_designs` from trying to contact CloudVision.
      This can be useful for offline testing or if CloudVision is not available or not configured for Zscaler integration.
