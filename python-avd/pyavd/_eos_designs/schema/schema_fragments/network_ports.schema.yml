            List of ranges using AVD range_expand syntax.
            For example:

            switch_ports:
              - Ethernet1
              - Ethernet2-48

            All switch_ports ranges are expanded into individual port configurations.

            For more details and examples of the `range_expand` syntax, see the [`arista.avd.range_expand` documentation](../../../docs/plugins/Filter_plugins/range_expand.md).

            Description or description template to be used on all ports.
            This can be a template using the AVD string formatter syntax: https://avd.arista.com/devel/roles/eos_designs/docs/how-to/custom-descriptions-names.html#avd-string-formatter-syntax.
            The available template fields are:
              - `endpoint_type` - always set to `network_port`.
              - `endpoint` - content of the `endpoint` key if set.

            The default description is set by `default_network_ports_description`.
            By default the description is templated from the `endpoint` key if set.
        endpoint:
          type: str
          description: Name or description of the endpoints connected to these ports.
