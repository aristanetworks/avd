      PREVIEW: The `wan_advertise_wan_servers_loopbacks_in_default_vrf` key is currently not supported

      Advertise Loopback0 in EVPN and enable next-hop-resolution for WAN route servers when set to true.
      By default, this is not done to speed up convergence. The consequence is that Loopback0 IPs from
      WAN route servers are not reachable over the WAN from the WAN routers.
    type: bool
    default: false
