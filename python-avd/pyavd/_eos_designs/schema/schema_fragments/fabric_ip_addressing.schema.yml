              This variable defines the Multi-chassis Link Aggregation (MLAG) algorithm used.
              Each MLAG link will have a /31* subnet with each subnet allocated from the relevant MLAG pool via a calculated offset.
              The offset is calculated using one of the following algorithms:
                - first_id: `(mlag_primary_id - 1) * 2` where `mlag_primary_id` is the ID of the first node defined under the node_group.
                  This allocation method will skip every other /31* subnet making it less space efficient than `odd_id`.
                - odd_id: `(odd_id - 1) / 2`. Requires the node_group to have a node with an odd ID and a node with an even ID.
                - same_subnet: the offset will always be zero.
                  This allocation method will cause every MLAG link to be addressed with the same /31* subnet.
              \* - The prefix length is configurable with a default of /31.
