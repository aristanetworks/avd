The files in this directory are frozen copies of the real schema and and data.
This is to ensure the tests of the schema tooling itself are consistent as the data models evolve.
The fully updated schemas are tested with the updated data under the `tests/pyavd/eos_cli_config_gen` and `tests/pyavd/eos_designs` folders.

The files in the ./output folder are temporary files generated by the tests.
