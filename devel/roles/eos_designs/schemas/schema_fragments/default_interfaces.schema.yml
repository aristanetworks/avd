      - Set default uplink, downlink, and MLAG interfaces, which will be used if these interfaces are not defined on a device (either directly or through inheritance).
      - These are defined based on the combination of node_type (e.g., l3leaf or spine) and a regex for matching the platform.
      - A list of interfaces or interface ranges can be specified.
      - Each list item supports range syntax that can be expanded into a list of interfaces. Interface range examples:
        - Ethernet49-52/1: Expands to [ Ethernet49/1, Ethernet50/1, Ethernet51/1, Ethernet52/1 ]
        - Ethernet1/31-34/1: Expands to [ Ethernet1/31/1, Ethernet1/32/1, Ethernet1/33/1, Ethernet1/34/1 ]
        - Ethernet49-50,53-54: Expands to [ Ethernet49, Ethernet50, Ethernet53, Ethernet54 ]
        - Ethernet1-2/1-4: Expands to [ Ethernet1/1, Ethernet1/2, Ethernet1/3, Ethernet1/4, Ethernet2/1, Ethernet2/2, Ethernet2/3, Ethernet2/4 ]
      - `uplink_interfaces` and `mlag_interfaces` under `default_interfaces` are directly inherited by `uplink_interfaces` and `mlag_interfaces`.
      - `downlink_interfaces` are referenced by the child switch (e.g., the leaf in a leaf/spine network). The child switch leverages an upstream switch's `default_downlink_interfaces` using the child switch ID.  This is then used to build `uplink_switch_interfaces` for that child.
        - In the case of `max_parallel_uplinks` > 1 the `default_downlink_interfaces` are mapped with consecutive downlinks per child ID.
        - Example for `max_parallel_uplinks: 2`, downlink interfaces will be mapped as `[ <downlink1 to leaf-id1>, <downlink2 to leaf-id1>, <downlink1 to leaf-id2>, <downlink2 to leaf-id2> ...]`
      - Please note that no default interfaces are defined in AVD itself. You will need to create your own based on the example below.

      Example:

      ```yaml
      default_interfaces:
        - types: [ spine, l3leaf ]
          platforms: [ "7050[SC]X3", vEOS.*, default ]
          uplink_interfaces: [ Ethernet49-54/1 ]
          mlag_interfaces: [ Ethernet55-56/1 ]
          downlink_interfaces: [ Ethernet1-32/1 ]
      ```
