# Schema ignores any key starting with underscore
# This can be used with custom templates or other custom features
# Setting custom keys like "_transceiver: xyz" using structured_config,
# the custom keys will be carried over to the structured_config output
# and can be picked up by eos_cli_config_gen or other roles.
# There is no validation performed on the custom keys, so they can be of any type.
