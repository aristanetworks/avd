# Common AVD group variables

# Test combination of flow tracking inputs across the FLOW_TRACKING_TESTS nodes.
# There are total of 8 nodes:
# spine1, spine2, leaf1, leaf2, leaf3 ( mlag ), leaf4 ( mlag ), l2-leaf1, l2-leaf2

# For l3_edge, core_interfaces:
# spine1 has flow tracking enabled by default, tracker type : default( sampled )
# spine2 has flow tracking disabled by default, tracker type : hardware, tracker name is also non-default in fabric settings

# We configure the combination of inputs for l3_interfaces, core_interfaces
# default setting, enabled: off, enabled: on, enabled:on override flow tracker name

# We also test downlinks which come from the leaf[1-4] on the spine nodes, spine 1 downlinks should
# have default flow tracker, whereas spine 2 downlinks should have custom flow tracker ( overridden in global settings ).

# Default Flow Tracker definition is also overridden in spine1. Extra trackers are provided in spine2 to check filtering

# Similarly for leafs:
# leaf1: has tracking enabled by default, leaf2: has tracking disabled by default
# and we configure their endpoints with varying configuration as before.
# leaf1, leaf2 are used for testing: uplinks, l3_interfaces (tenants), endpoints

# leaf3, leaf4 are used for testing: mlag_interfaces, uplinks( with overridden name in fabric setting ), downlinks

# l2-leaf1, l2-leaf2 are used for testing l2 ports uplinks i.e port-channels

# node l3_interfaces are tested in CV_PATHFINDER_TESTS
