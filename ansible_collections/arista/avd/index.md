# Arista Validated Designs

<center><img src="media/avd-logo.png" alt="Arista AVD Overview" width="800"/></center>

Arista Validated Designs (AVD) is an extensible data model that defines Arista's Unified Cloud Network architecture as "code".

**[Documentation](https://avd.arista.com)**

**[Source Code](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd)**

**[Examples](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/tree/devel/ansible_collections/arista/avd/examples)**

## Features

- **Flexibility with Open Data Models:** Extensible fabric-wide network models, simplifying configuration, delivering consistency, and reducing errors
- **Simplification through Multi-Domain Automation:** A framework that can automate the data center, campus or wide area network, enabled by a consistent EOS software image and management platform
- **Comprehensive Workflows:** Automating the full life cycle of network provisioning from config generation to pre and post-deployment validation, and self-documentation of the network

## AVD Ansible Collection

[Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/) supports Ansible for managing devices running Arista's **Extensible Operating System (EOS)** natively through it's **EOS API (eAPI)** or [**CloudVision Portal (CVP)**](https://www.arista.com/en/products/eos/eos-cloudvision). The collection includes a set of Ansible roles and modules to help kick-start your automation with Arista. The various roles and templates provided are designed to be customized and extended to your needs.

### Collection installation

Ansible galaxy hosts all stable versions of the `arista.avd` collection. Installation from ansible-galaxy is the most convenient approach for consuming `arista.avd` content. Please follow the collection installation [guide](docs/installation/collection-installation.md).

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install arista.avd
```

## PyAVD

PyAVD is a python package providing some of the features from the arista.avd Ansible collection without requiring Ansible. PyAVD leverages the same logic as the Ansible collection, so the generated outputs should be exactly the same based on the same inputs.

PyAVD does not provide any inventory or variable management, so PyAVD cannot replace a full Ansible based solution by itself. PyAVD could serve as an element in larger framework.

```shell
pip3 install pyavd
```
