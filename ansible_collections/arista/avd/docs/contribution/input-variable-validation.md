# Validation of Input Variables

!!! NOTE
    - Some schema validations are not implemented yet.

`eos_designs` and `eos_cli_config_gen` support a wide range of input variables described under the role documentation sections.

Internally the supported data models are described in the proprietary "AVD Schema" format, which is used to perform validation of
the input variables at run-time. The same schema is also used to generate the role documentation describing the supported data
models.

For details on the schema format see the [Schema Details](#schema-details) section below.

## Automatic Type Conversion

The validation of input variables is performed in most AVD Action Plugins. The validation also supports automatic conversion of
variable types, if configured in the schema. The supported types that can be converted from depends on the type to be converted to.
The current implementation supports the automatic conversions listed below.

| From (`convert_types`) | To (`type`) |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `bool`, `str` | `int` |
| `int`, `str` | `bool` |
| `bool`, `int` | `str` |

An example of input variable conversion is `bgp_as`. `bgp_as` is expected as a string (`str`) since 32-bit AS numbers can be
written with dot-notation such as `"65001.10000"`. Most deployments use 16-bit AS numbers, where the setting `bgp_as: 65001`
will be interpreted as an integer in YAML, unless it is enclosed in quotes `bgp_as: "65001"`. In the schema for `bgp_as` the
`convert_types` option is configured to `['int']` which means AVD Action Plugins will automatically convert
`bgp_as: 65001` to `bgp_as: "65001"`.

Data conversion processing also handles deprecation warnings.

## Validation Options

Schema validation is built in to the central Action plugins used in AVD. Each plugin runs variable type conversion first and then
performs validation of the converted data.

By default any data validation issues will trigger errors - blocking further processing.
This behavior can be adjusted by setting the variables described below.

!!! danger
    The input variable `avd_data_validation_mode` now has a default value of `error`, and while it can be set to `warning`, this is highly discouraged.
    All AVD code relies on the validation to ensure valid data, so the code assumes that the data is valid.

    If the validation mode is set to `warning`, execution will continue with invalid data, which can lead to hard-to-read errors or incorrect behavior.

```yaml
# Validation Mode for AVD input data validation | Optional
# During validation, messages will generated with information about the host(s) and key(s) which failed validation.
# "error" will produce error messages and fail the task.
# "warning" will produce warning messages.
avd_data_validation_mode: < "error" | "warning" | default -> "error" >
```

## Schema Details

The AVD Schema format is a proprietary schema inspired by JSON Schema, Ansible Argument Specification and Arista
CloudVision Studios formats.

The AVD Schema has unique features which are not supported or possible with any of the mentioned schema formats.
Schema converters can be developed as needed.

Here is an example of a schema fragment for `bgp_as`:

```yaml
type: dict
allow_other_keys: true
keys:
  bgp_as:
    display_name: BGP AS
    description: AS number to use to configure overlay when "overlay_routing_protocol" == IBGP
    type: str
    convert_types:
      - int
```

This fragment will be merged with other fragments during development, to form the complete role schema.

For reference, the full Role Schemas can be found here:

- [`eos_designs` AVD Schema](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/tree/devel/python-avd/pyavd/_eos_designs/schema/eos_designs.schema.yml)
- [`eos_cli_config_gen` AVD Schema](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/tree/devel/python-avd/pyavd/_eos_cli_config_gen/schema/eos_cli_config_gen.schema.yml)

The supported schema options depend on the type of variable that is described. The supported types are `int`, `bool`, `str`,
`dict` and `list`. The schema does not support mixed types for the same variable, but the automatic type conversion mentioned
above can address the usability aspect by helping the user with common mistakes.

The supported schema options for AVD Schema are described in a meta-schema using JSON Schema Draft-7 format. The meta-schema
can be seen [here](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/tree/devel/python-avd/pyavd/_schema/avd_meta_schema.json). In addition, below is a more detailed description of the supported
schema options per variable type.

All schema options (ex. `type`, `max`, `valid_values`) are validated individually, and to pass the validation, the data must
conform to all the rules given by the schema options.
This means that the validator may report multiple errors about the same piece of data if it violates more than on rule.
This also means that a poorly written schema could have conflicting schema options, which may not allow any value. For example `type: str` schema with `min_length: 10` and `max_length: 5` would never be satisfied.
