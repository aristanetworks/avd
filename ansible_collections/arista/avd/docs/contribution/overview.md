# Arista Validated Designs Development

**Arista Validated Designs (AVD)** is maintained as a [GitHub project](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd) under the Apache 2 license. Users are encouraged to submit GitHub issues for feature requests and bug reports.

## Governance

AVD is a community-based Free Open Source Software (FOSS) project sponsored by [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/). Arista Networks supports Ansible for managing devices running the EOS operating system natively through eAPI or [CloudVision Portal (CVP)](https://www.arista.com/en/products/eos/eos-cloudvision). This collection includes a set of Ansible roles and modules to help kick-start your automation with Arista. The various roles and templates provided are designed to be customized and extended to your needs.

The AVD Core Team is responsible for the direction and execution of the code that gets committed to the project.

The following individuals are on the AVD Core Team:

- Carl Buchmann ([@carlbuchmann](https://github.com/carlbuchmann))
- Claus Holbech ([@ClausHolbechArista](https://github.com/ClausHolbechArista))
- Julio Perez ([@JulioPDX](https://github.com/JulioPDX))
- Guillaume Mulocher ([@gmuloc](https://github.com/gmuloc))
- Carl Baillargeon ([@carl-baillargeon](https://github.com/carl-baillargeon))

## Contributing

We welcome all forms of contribution to AVD, whether to the code base, docs, tutorials, or user guides. If you have other ideas for contributing, don't hesitate to open an issue or discuss them in one of the forums below.

### Communication

The following links outline the best ways to communicate and engage on all things AVD:

#### GitHub

- [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/issues) - All feature requests, bug reports, and other substantial changes should be documented in an issue.
- [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/discussions) - The preferred forum for general discussion and support issues. Ideal for shaping a feature request before submitting an issue.

GitHub's discussions are the best place to get help or propose rough ideas for new functionality. Their integration with GitHub allows cross-referencing and converting posts to issues as needed. Below are some examples of categories used for discussions:

- **General** - General community discussion.
- **Ideas** - Ideas for new functionality that still needs to be prepared for a formal feature request.
- **Q&A** - Request help with installing or using AVD.

### Deprecation Policy

The deprecation policy will be such that at least one release will inform users of a feature that will be deprecated in the next release.

### Versioning

Semantic Versioning ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)) is used for AVD versioning.

### Contributor Workflow

The AVD repository follows a [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) to collaborate on the project with a personal fork.

The following documents the lifecycle of work within AVD:

1. Open/request a feature enhancement or file a bug
   - If a bug, please see [reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs).
   - If feature request or enhancement, continue.
2. Open a GitHub Issue
    - The issue will be reviewed and approved by a maintainer.
3. Submit a [Pull Request (PR)](#submitting-pull-requests) referencing the issue with `Fixes #<issue number>`.

If you follow these steps, a GitHub Issue will be opened before you submit a PR. However, a PR may come in without being discussed in an Issue or Discussion. While we don't advocate for this, you should be aware of the process that will be followed for those circumstances.

Should this happen, and if you followed the project guidelines, have sample tests, and code quality, you will first be acknowledged for your work; thank you in advance. After that, the PR will be quickly reviewed to ensure that it makes sense as a contribution to the project and to gauge the work effort or issues with merging into the *devel* branch. If the effort required by the core team is manageable, it'll likely still be a few weeks before it gets thoroughly reviewed and merged. After that, it will just depend on the current backlog.

### Contributing to Arista Validated Designs

Contributing pull requests are gladly welcomed for this repository. If you are planning a significant change, please start a discussion first to ensure we can merge it.

#### Branching model

- The **`devel`** branch corresponds to the release actively under development.
- The [release tags](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/tags) correspond to stable releases.
  - For major and minor releases, release tags are applied directly on the `devel` branch.
  - For bug fix release, release tags are applied to `releases/*` branch.
- Fork the repository and create a branch based on **`devel`** to set up a dev environment if you want to open a PR.
  - We do not enforce any branch naming convention.
  - All PRs should be submitted towards the `devel` branch.

#### Reporting Bugs

- First, ensure that you're running the [latest development version](../installation/collection-installation.md#install-latest-devel-version-from-avd-github) of AVD. If you're running an older version, it's possible that the bug has already been fixed.

- Next, check the GitHub [issues list](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/issues) to see if the bug you've found has already been reported. If you think you may be experiencing a reported issue that hasn't already been resolved, please click "add a reaction" in the top right corner of the issue and add a thumbs up (+1). Also, add a comment describing how it's affecting your installation. This will allow us to prioritize bugs based on how many users are affected.

- When submitting an issue, please be as descriptive as possible. Be sure to provide all information requests in the issue template, including:

  - The environment in which AVD is running
  - The exact steps that can be taken to reproduce the issue
  - Expected and observed behavior
  - Any error messages generated
  - Screenshots (if applicable)

- Please avoid prepending any tag (for example, "[Bug]") to the issue title. The issue will be reviewed by a maintainer after submission, and the appropriate labels will be applied for categorization.

- Keep in mind that bugs are prioritized based on their severity and how much work is required to resolve them. It may take some time for someone to address your issue.

#### Feature Requests

- First, check the GitHub [issues list](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/discussions) to see if the feature you're requesting is already listed. If the feature you'd like to see has already been requested and is open, click "add a reaction" in the top right corner of the issue and add a thumbs up (+1). This ensures that the issue has a better chance of receiving attention. Also, feel free to add a comment with any additional justification for the feature. However, note that comments with no substance other than a "+1" will be deleted. Please use GitHub's reactions feature to indicate your support.

- Before filing a new feature request, consider starting with a GitHub Discussion. The feedback you receive there will help validate and shape the proposed feature before filing a formal issue. Suppose the feature request isn't accepted into the *current* or *near-term* backlog. In that case, it will get converted to a discussion anyway.

- Good feature requests are very narrowly defined. Be sure to describe the functionality and data models being proposed thoroughly. The more effort you put into writing a feature request, the better its chance is of being implemented. Overly broad feature requests will be closed.

- When submitting a feature request on GitHub, be sure to include all information requested by the issue template, including:

  - A detailed description of the proposed functionality
  - A use case for the feature; who would use it and what value it would add to AVD
  - A rough description of changes necessary to the database schema (if applicable)
  - Any third-party libraries or other resources which would be involved
  - Please avoid prepending any tag (for example, "[Feature]") to the issue title.

The issue will be reviewed by a moderator after submission, and the appropriate labels will be applied for categorization.

#### Submitting Pull Requests

- If you're interested in contributing to AVD, check out our [development tooling](development-tooling.md) documentation for tips on setting up your development environment.

- It's recommended to open an issue **before** starting work on a pull request and discuss your idea with the AVD maintainers before beginning work. This will save time on something we might be unable to implement. When suggesting a new feature, ensure it will be consistent with any work already in progress.

- Once you've opened or identified an issue you'd like to work on, ask that it be assigned to you so that others know it's being worked on. A maintainer will then mark the issue as "accepted."

- All new functionality must include relevant tests where applicable.

- When submitting a pull request, please work off the `devel` branch rather than `releases/*`. The `devel` branch is used for ongoing development, while `releases/*` is used for tagging stable releases.

- In most cases, adding a changelog entry is unnecessary: A maintainer will take care of this when the PR is merged. This helps avoid merge conflicts resulting from multiple PRs being submitted simultaneously.

- All code submissions should meet the following criteria (CI will enforce these checks):
  - Jinja2 templates follow our [guidelines](style-guide.md).
  - Molecule is updated with data covering your fix.
  - Molecule artifacts are updated with your coverage.
  - Python syntax is valid.
  - All unit tests pass successfully.

- A PR can be opened before all the work is complete. The PR state should be set to **draft** in this situation. The maintainer team will review PRs marked as ready for review (not in draft).

- To automate release-notes creation and make the filtering process more manageable, it's strongly recommended to use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) syntax, at least for the PR title. The scope should be module or role updated. As a reminder, the list below provides all supported commit types and scopes:

  - **Types**:

    - `Feat`: Create a capability, e.g., feature, test, dependency.
    - `Fix`: Fix an issue, e.g., bug, typo, accident, misstatement.
    - `Cut`: Remove a capability, e.g., feature, test, dependency.
    - `Doc`: Refactor of documentation, e.g., help files.
    - `CI`: Update CI components, e.g., molecule files or GitHub Actions.
    - `Bump`: Increase the version of something, e.g., dependency.
    - `Test`: Add or refactor anything regarding a test, e.g., adding new testCases.
    - `Refactor`: A code change that MUST be just a refactoring.
    - `Revert`: Change back to the previous commit

  - **Scopes**:

    - `{{ role_name }}`: AVD role impacted by PR. **Required** for `Feat`, `Cut`, and `Fix` types
    - `plugins`: To use when AVD plugin is impacted by PR. **Required** for `Feat`, `Cut`, and `Fix` types
    - `requirements`: To use when using the `Bump` type and when any AVD requirement is updated

    !!! info "Scopes"
        The scope is optional and can be ignored safely if your PR covers an undefined scope.
