# eos_designs_facts

!!! note
    Always use the FQCN (Fully Qualified Collection Name) `arista.avd.eos_designs_facts` when using this plugin.

Set eos_designs facts

## Synopsis

The `arista.avd.eos_designs_facts` module is an Ansible Action Plugin providing the following capabilities:

- Set `avd_switch_facts` fact containing both `switch` facts per host.
- Set `avd_topology_peers` fact containing list of downlink switches per host.
  This list is built based on the `uplink_switches` from all other hosts.
- Set `avd_overlay_peers` fact containing list of EVPN or MPLS overlay peers per host.
  This list is built based on the `evpn_route_servers` and `mpls_route_reflectors` from all other hosts.

The plugin is designed to `run_once`. With this, Ansible will set the same facts on all devices, so all devices can lookup values of any other device without using the slower `hostvars`.

The facts can also be copied to the &#34;root&#34; `switch` in a task run per-device (see example below)

The module is used in `arista.avd.eos_designs` to set facts for devices, which are then used by jinja templates and python module in `arista.avd.eos_designs` to generate the `structured_configuration`.

## Parameters

| Argument | Type | Required | Default | Value Restrictions | Description |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| <samp>template_output</samp> | bool | False | None |  | If true, the output data will be run through another jinja2 rendering before returning. This is to resolve any input values with inline jinja using variables/facts set by the input templates. |
| <samp>validation_mode</samp> | str | False | error | Valid values:<br>- <code>error</code><br>- <code>warning</code> | Run validation in either &#34;error&#34; or &#34;warning&#34; mode.<br>Validation will validate the input variables according to the schema.<br>During validation, messages will be generated with information about the host(s) and key(s) which failed validation.<br>validation_mode:error will produce error messages and fail the task.<br>validation_mode:warning will produce warning messages. |
| <samp>cprofile_file</samp> | str | False | None |  | Filename for storing cprofile data used to debug performance issues.<br>Running cprofile will slow down performance in it self, so only set this while troubleshooting. |
