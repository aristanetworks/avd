# Porting Guide for Ansible AVD 5.x.x

Major releases of AVD can contain breaking changes. This porting guide addresses how to update your inventory
and playbooks to be compatible with new default behaviors and changed data models when upgrading from AVD 4.x versions.

!!! note
    To upgrade from AVD version 3.x, first upgrade to AVD 4.10 using the [Porting Guide for Ansible AVD 4.x.x](https://avd.arista.com/4.10/docs/porting-guides/4.x.x.html)
    and then upgrade to 5.x with this guide.

Users of `eos_designs` do not have to consider the changes in `eos_cli_config_gen`, since those adaptions are
built into `eos_designs`.
