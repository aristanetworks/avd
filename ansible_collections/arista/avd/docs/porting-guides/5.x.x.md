# Porting Guide for Ansible AVD 5.x.x

Major releases of AVD can contain breaking changes. This porting guide addresses how to update your inventory
and playbooks to be compatible with new default behaviors and changed data models when upgrading from AVD 4.x versions.

!!! note
    To upgrade from AVD version 3.x, first upgrade to AVD 4.10 using the [Porting Guide for Ansible AVD 4.x.x](https://avd.arista.com/4.10/docs/porting-guides/4.x.x.html)
    and then upgrade to 5.x with this guide.

Users of `eos_designs` do not have to consider the changes in `eos_cli_config_gen`, since those adaptions are
built into `eos_designs`.

## Common changes

### Data model changes from "dict-of-dicts" to "list-of-dicts"

In AVD 4.0.0 and across both `eos_designs` and `eos_cli_config_gen`, *all* "dict-of-dicts" data models with user-defined keys were changed to "list-of-dicts".
In AVD 4.x inputs were auto-converted to the new data models.

As of AVD 5.0.0 the automatic conversion from dict-of-dicts has been removed, so it is required to update the input data to the new data models.
The `avd_data_conversion_mode` key has also been removed.

Errors will be raised for each data model not conforming to the list type when running AVD:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml
<...>
ERROR! [host1]: 'Validation Error: access_lists': {'ACL-01': {'sequence_numbers': {10: {'actio<...abbreviated...>4 any'}}}} is not of type 'list'
```

As an example, `ethernet_interfaces` was changed from:

```yaml
ethernet_intefaces:
  Ethernet1:   # <-- User defined key
    <...>
```

to:

```yaml
ethernet_interfaces:
  - name: Ethernet1   # <-- "name" here is called the "primary_key" which must have a unique value across all list elements
    <...>
```

## Removal Ansible tags from AVD roles

Support for Ansible tags across AVD roles has been replaced with variables to control this execution of various parts of AVD.

The previous implementation of Ansible tags was not consistent and mostly undocumented. It often lead to inconsistent behaviors depending
when the tags were used with `--tags` vs. `--skip-tags`.

AVD now supports a number of variables which allow detailed control of which areas of AVD should be executed.
Variables are only added for the roles providing multiple optional functionalities.

| Ansible Role | Variable | Default value | Description |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| All | `avd_verify_requirements` | `true` | Verify Ansible and Python requirements. |
| All | avd_create_directories | `true` | Create required output directories if not present. |
| `arista.avd.eos_designs` | `avd_eos_designs_debug` | `false` | Dump all vars and facts per device after generating `avd_switch_facts`. |
| `arista.avd.eos_designs` | `avd_eos_designs_structured_config` | `true` | Generate structured configuration per device. |
| `arista.avd.eos_designs` | `eos_designs_documentation.enable` | `true` | Generate fabric Markdown documentation. |
| `arista.avd.eos_designs` | `eos_designs_documentation.topology_csv` | `false` | Generate Topology CSV with all interfaces towards other devices. |
| `arista.avd.eos_designs` | `eos_designs_documentation.p2p_links_csv` | `false` | Generate P2P links CSV with all routed point-to-point links between devices. |
| `arista.avd.eos_designs` | `avd_eos_designs_unset_facts` | `true` | Unset `avd_switch_facts` to gain a small performance improvement since Ansible needs to handle fewer variables. |
| `arista.avd.eos_cli_config_gen` | `eos_cli_config_gen_configuration.enable` | `true` | Generate device EOS configurations. |
| `arista.avd.eos_cli_config_gen` | `eos_cli_config_gen_documentation.enable` | `true` | Generate device Markdown documentation. |
| `arista.avd.cvp_configlet_upload` | `execute_tasks` | `false` | Execute pending tasks on CloudVision after uploading configlets. |
| `arista.avd.dhcp_provisioner` | `avd_dhcp_provisioner_provision` | `true` | Run `arista.cvp.dhcp_configuration` in either online or offline mode. |
| `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp` | `avd_eos_config_deploy_cvp_provision` | `true` | Deploy/remove the generated configs and containers on CloudVision. |
| `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp` | `avd_eos_config_deploy_cvp_execute_existing_tasks` or `execute_tasks` | `false` | `cv_collection: v1` only<br>Execute *existing* tasks on CloudVision *before* uploading configlets. |
| `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp` | `avd_eos_config_deploy_cvp_execute_configlet_tasks` or `execute_tasks` | `false` | Execute pending tasks on CloudVision after uploading configlets. |
| `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp` | `avd_eos_config_deploy_cvp_execute_container_tasks` or `execute_tasks` | `false` | Execute pending tasks on CloudVision after creating containers. |
| `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp` | `avd_eos_config_deploy_cvp_execute_device_tasks` or `execute_tasks` | `false` | Execute pending tasks on CloudVision after onboarding, moving or changing devices. |
| `arista.avd.eos_validate_state` | - | - | See [here](#changes-to-role-aristaavdeos_validate_state) for details on changes in `eos_validate_state`. |

The tasks or functions mentioned will execute when the role is imported/included if the variable is set to `true`. Otherwise it will not.

This change may require updates to playbooks, "Makefiles" or scripts, to execute the same parts of AVD. It is still possible to skip importing a role by using
Ansible tags in the playbook. The tags will be applied to/match all tasks in the imported/included AVD role.

The default behavior is the same as for previous versions of AVD, except for the CSV files which are no longer generated by default.

For example to run AVD without generating documentation, the playbook can be updated like this:

```diff
 - name: Build Configurations and Documentation # (1)!
   hosts: FABRIC
   gather_facts: false
   tasks:

     - name: Generate AVD Structured Configurations and Fabric Documentation # (2)!
       ansible.builtin.import_role:
         name: arista.avd.eos_designs
       vars:
         eos_designs_documentation:
           enabled: false

     - name: Generate Device Configurations and Documentation # (3)!
       ansible.builtin.import_role:
         name: arista.avd.eos_cli_config_gen
       vars:
         generate_device_documentation: false
```

## Removal of Ansible plugins

The following ansible plugins have been removed from the `arista.avd` Ansible collection in v5.0.0.

| Plugin type | Plugin name | Replacement |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Filter | `arista.avd.convert_dicts` | The internal `arista.avd.convert_dicts` filter plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |
| Filter | `arista.avd.hash_passphrase` | Use `arista.avd.snmp_hash` instead. |

| Filter | `arista.avd.generate_route_target` | Use the builtin `ansible.builtin.regex_replace` filter instead like `{{ <short_esi> \| ansible.builtin.regex_replace('(\\d{2})(\\d{2}):(\\d{2})(\\d{2}):(\\d{2})(\\d{2})', '\\1:\\2:\\3:\\4:\\5:\\6') }}`. |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd.deploy_to_cv` | Use `arista.avd.cv_workflow` instead. |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd.batch_template` | The internal `arista.avd.batch_template` action plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |

| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd._emit_warning` | The internal `arista.avd._emit_warning` action plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |

## Changes to role arista.avd.eos_designs

TODO: Level 3 sections for each change with details on how to migrate

### Removed `redistribute igmp` from BGP vlan config belonging to a VRF with evpn multicast

AVD versions below 5.0.0 configures `redistribute igmp` under BGP for all SVIs when `evpn_l2_multicast` is True but configuring `redistribute igmp` with both L2 and L3 EVPN Multicast enabled will take up additional control-plane and data-plane resources.

In AVD version 5.0.0 by default `redistribute igmp` is only configured when `evpn_l2_multicast` is True and `evpn_l3_multicast` for the VRF is False.
In order to retain the previous behavior for SVIs under BGP where both `evpn_l2_multicast` and `evpn_l3_multicast` are enabled set `always_redistribute_igmp` key to True either for all SVIs within the Tenant or for each SVIs individually.

```diff
tenants:
  - name: Tenant_B
    evpn_l3_multicast:
      enabled: true
      <...>
    evpn_l2_multicast:
      enabled: true
+     always_redistribute_igmp: true
      <...>
  - name: Tenant_C
    evpn_l3_multicast:
      enabled: true
      <...>
    evpn_l2_multicast:
      enabled: true
      <...>
    vrfs:
      - name: TEN_C_L3_MULTICAST_ENABLED
        svis:
          - id: 136
            name: "L3_L2_MULTICAST_ENABLED_136"
            evpn_l2_multicast:
+             always_redistribute_igmp: true
```

### `vrf_id` is used instead of `vrf_vni` to calculate the IP address of EVPN underlay multicast group for a VRF

AVD versions below 5.0.0 uses `vrf_vni` in the algorithm to set the offset in order to get the IP address of EVPN underlay multicast group.

In AVD version 5.0.0, `vrf_id` is used instead of `vrf_vni` to calculate the offset for IP address of EVPN underlay multicast group for a VRF when `evpn_l3_multicast` is enabled. The configurations will only change in case `vrf_id` and `vrf_vni` are set to different values or `evpn_l3_multicast.evpn_underlay_l3_multicast_group` is set under `vrfs`.

To retain the previous configuration, set group ip directly under the `vrfs` using `evpn_l3_multicast.evpn_underlay_l3_multicast_group`

```diff
tenants:
  - name: Tenant_C
    evpn_l3_multicast:
      enabled: true
    vrfs:
      - name: TEN_C_L3_MULTICAST_ENABLED_130_131
        evpn_l3_multicast:
          enabled: true
+         evpn_underlay_l3_multicast_group: 232.0.64.2
        <...>
```

### Base class for custom IP addressing `AvdIpAddressing` was moved

The `AvdIpAddressing` class was moved from the Ansible collection to `pyavd.api.ip_addressing`. Import statements must be updated.

```diff
- from ansible_collections.arista.avd.roles.eos_designs.python_modules.ip_addressing import AvdIpAddressing
+ from pyavd.api.ip_addressing import AvdIpAddressing
```

### Base class for custom interface descriptions `AvdInterfaceDescriptions` breaking changes

The `AvdInterfaceDescriptions` class and the associated `InterfaceDescriptionData` data class were moved from the Ansible collection
to `pyavd.api.interface_descriptions`. Import statements must be updated.

```diff
- from ansible_collections.arista.avd.roles.eos_designs.python_modules.interface_descriptions import AvdInterfaceDescriptions, InterfaceDescriptionData
+ from pyavd.api.interface_descriptions import AvdInterfaceDescriptions, InterfaceDescriptionData
```

Some methods of the `AvdInterfaceDescriptions` class were collapsed.
The following table indicates the removed methods and the replacement ones to
adjust the code. Note that the new method signatures are different.

| Removed method signature | Replacement method signature |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `underlay_ethernet_interfaces(self, link_type: str, link_peer: str, link_peer_interface: str) -> str` | `underlay_ethernet_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `underlay_port_channel_interfaces(self, link_peer: str, link_peer_channel_group_id: int, link_channel_description: str) -> str:` | `underlay_port_channel_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `mlag_ethernet_interfaces(self, mlag_interface: str) -> str:` | `mlag_ethernet_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `mlag_port_channel_interfaces(self) -> str:` | `mlag_ethernet_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `connected_endpoints_ethernet_interfaces(self, peer: str = None, peer_interface: str = None, adapter_description: str = None) -> str:` | `connected_endpoint_ethernet_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `connected_endpoints_port_channel_interfaces(self, peer: str = None, adapter_description: str = None, adapter_port_channel_description: str = None) -> str:` | `connected_endpoint_port_channel_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `overlay_loopback_interface(self, overlay_loopback_description: str = None) -> str` | `router_id_loopback_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `vtep_loopback_interface(self) -> str` | `vtep_loopback_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |

For any method that was not previously overwritten, there should be no output change as compared to AVD 4.10.0.

### Removal of deprecated data models

The following data model keys have been removed from `eos_designs` in v5.0.0.

| Removed key | New key |
| ----------- | ------- |
| cvp_instance_ip | cvp_instance_ips |
| <connected_endpoints_key>[].adapters[].port_channel.short_esi | <connected_endpoints_key>[].adapters[].ethernet_segment.short_esi |
| network_ports[].port_channel.short_esi | network_ports[].ethernet_segment.short_esi |
| port_profiles[].port_channel.short_esi | port_profiles[].ethernet_segment.short_esi |

### The default platform settings for R3-series now have the TCAM profile "vxlan-routing"

Starting AVD 5.0.0, the default platform settings for `7280R3`, `7500R3` and `7800R3` platforms now contain `tcam_profile: vxlan-routing`
This change is based on a new Arista best practice for VXLAN deployments with the R3-series.
Not using this TCAM profile can lead to incorrect handling of VXLAN IPv6 NS packets.

!!! warning
    Since applying a TCAM profile will cause reprogramming of the forwarding processor, it can lead to disturbances to the network services.

    Please work with your Arista account team to decide if the new default is the right choice for your network, and how to apply it.

To retain the old configuration with no TCAM profile the default platform settings can be overridden with the new `custom_platform_settings` key:

```diff
+custom_platform_settings:
+  - platforms:
+      - 7280R3
+    reload_delay:
+      mlag: 900
+      non_mlag: 1020
+  - platforms:
+      - 7500R3
+      - 7800R3
+    management_interface: Management0
+    reload_delay:
+      mlag: 900
+      non_mlag: 1020
```

### Structured Configuration merged from SVI profiles is now deep merged instead of replaced

When merging `structured_config` from SVI profiles and parent profiles, AVD versions below 5.0.0 replaced the entire `structured_config` object with the most specific definition of `structured_config`.

With AVD version 5.0.0 `structured_config` is now deep-merged, same as for other profiles in AVD. This allows the user to contribute different parts of the `structured_config` from profiles or parent profiles.

Example:

```yaml
svi_profiles:
  - name: TEST1
    parent_profile: TEST2
    structured_config:
      no_autostate: true
  - name: TEST2
    structured_config:
      description: foo

tenants:
  - name: mytenant
    vrfs:
      - name: myvrf
        svis:
          - id: 10
            profile: TEST1
            structured_config:
              no_autostate: false

```

With AVD versions below 5.0.0 this produced an effective `structured_config` for SVI 10 of:

```yaml
no_autostate: false
```

Only the most specific entry got applied.

With AVD version 5.0.0 the same inputs will produce an effective `structured_config` for SVI 10 of:

```yaml
description: foo      # <-- Inherited from profile which inherited from parent_profile
no_autostate: false   # <-- Set on SVI, overriding the setting from svi_profile
```

Depending on the complexity of the deployment, it may require changes to the SVI and profiles to retain the previous configuration output.

### MLAG L3 Peering VLAN 4093 is no longer created when `underlay_routing_protocol: 'none'`

AVD versions below 5.0.0 created the MLAG L3 peering VLAN 4093, even when no L3 MLAG peering was created using an underlay routing protocol.
This happened in cases where `underlay_routing_protocol` was set to `none`.

In AVD version 5.0.0 the MLAG L3 peering VLAN 4093 is not longer created when `underlay_routing_protocol` is `'none'`.
Instead an MLAG peering VLAN will be created for VRF `default`, if it is defined under network services, using the same MLAG peer VLAN logic as for
other VRFs; `<mlag_ibgp_peering_vrfs.base_vlan - default 3000> - 1 + <vrf_id>`.

The peer VLAN config can be retained by setting `mlag_ibgp_peering_vlan: 4093` under the VRF, by using `custom_structured_configuration` or by setting `underlay_routing_protocol` to something else than `none`.

### BGP is now configured for Network services VRFs even if 'evpn' is not part of the address-families

AVD versions below 5.0.0 did not generate BGP configuration for VRFs unless the node type included `evpn` or `mpls` under `default_address_families` *and* the
VRF had the same `evpn` or `mpls` defined under `address_families` (default is `['evpn']`).

AVD version 4.6.0 introduced the toggle `new_network_services_bgp_vrf_config: <bool; default=false>` to change this behavior by no longer requiring `evpn`
in the address-families, but instead it always configured BGP for all VRFs. This toggle has been removed in AVD 5.0.0 since this is now part of the default
behavior.

With AVD version 5.0.0, the logic of whether to configure BGP for a network services VRF has been improved with the following rules:

- **New**: Always/never configure BGP for the VRF according to the new optional `bgp.enabled` setting. This takes precedence over all other rules.
- **Existing**: If the VRF is part of an overlay (`evpn` or `mpls`), BGP will be configured for the VRF.
- **New**: If any BGP peers are configured under the VRF, BGP will be configured for the VRF. This is useful for L2LS designs with VRFs.
- **Improved**: If uplink type is `p2p-vrfs` *and* the VRF is included in the uplink VRFs, BGP will be configured for the VRF.

It is possible to forcefully add or remove BGP configuration per VRF by setting:

```yaml
<network_services_key e.g. tenants>:
  - name: mytenant
    vrfs:
      - name: myvrf
        bgp:
          enabled: <bool>  # <-- New optional setting to either always or never configure BGP for the VRF
```

### Default interface descriptions are changed for more consistency

With AVD version 5.0.0 the default interface descriptions are changed to give better consistency.

#### Router ID Loopback

The default interface description for `Loopback0` changes to `ROUTER_ID` for all designs.
Previously this description varied depending on the network design and chosen protocols.

The `router_id_loopback_description` or the deprecated `overlay_loopback_description` settings still takes precedence,
so no changes will be seen if either of these are set.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
 # Using the new 'router_id_loopback_description' which replaces the deprecated 'overlay_loopback_description'
+router_id_loopback_description: "EVPN_Overlay_Peering"
```

#### VTEP Loopback

The default interface description for `Loopback1` (or the interface set with `vtep_loopback`) changes to `VXLAN_TUNNEL_SOURCE`.
Previously the description was `VTEP_VXLAN_Tunnel_Source`.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+vtep_loopback_description: "VTEP_VXLAN_Tunnel_Source"
```

#### Underlay point-to-point L3 ethernet interfaces

The interface description for the L3 point-to-point interfaces changes to `P2P_<peer>_<peer_interface>_VRF_<vrf>`. Previously the description was `P2P_LINK_TO_<peer | upper>_<peer_interface>_vrf_<vrf>`. The VRF suffix is only added when using `uplink_type: p2p-vrfs`.

The interfaces using this are routed uplinks and `p2p_links` defined under `l3_edge` or `core_interfaces`.

Setting the description directly on `p2p_links` defined under `l3_edge` or `core_interfaces` still takes precedence.

The default descriptions can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+default_underlay_p2p_ethernet_description: "P2P_LINK_TO_{peer!u}_{peer_interface}{vrf?<_vrf_}"
```

The description fields support templates. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

#### Underlay point-to-point L3 port-channel interfaces

The interface description for the L3 point-to-point port-channels changes to `P2P_<peer>_<peer_interface>`. Previously the default description was `P2P_LINK_TO_<peer>_<peer_interface>`.

The port-channels using this are `p2p_links` defined under `l3_edge` or `core_interfaces`.

Setting the description directly on `p2p_links` defined under `l3_edge` or `core_interfaces` still takes precedence.

In AVD 5.0.0 it is also possible to control the port-channel description separately by setting the `description` key under `port_channel`. It will replace the full port-channel interface description.

The default descriptions can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+default_underlay_p2p_port_channel_description: "P2P_LINK_TO_{peer}_{peer_interface}"
```

The description fields support templates. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

#### Underlay L2 ethernet interfaces

The interface description for the L2 uplink/downlink interfaces changes to `L2_<peer>_<peer_interface>`. Previously the description was `<peer | upper>_<peer_interface>`.

The interfaces using this are the member interfaces of port-channel uplinks.

The descriptions can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+underlay_l2_ethernet_description: "{peer!u}_{peer_interface}"
```

The description field support templates. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

#### Underlay L2 port-channel interfaces

The interface description for the L2 uplink/downlink port-channels changes to `L2_<peer_node_group_or_peer>_<peer_interface>`. Previously the default description was `<peer_node_group_or_uppercase_peer>_Po<peer_port_channel_id>`.
The field `peer_node_group_or_peer` will contain the peer's node group name for MLAG pairs or EVPN A/A nodes or the peer's hostname for a single switch.

The port-channels using this are port-channel uplinks.

The descriptions can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+underlay_l2_port_channel_description: "{peer_node_group_or_uppercase_peer}_Po{peer_port_channel_id}"
```

The description field support templates. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

#### Out-of-band management interface

The default interface description for the management interface changes to `OOB_MANAGEMENT`.
Previously the description was `oob_management`.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+mgmt_interface_description: "oob_management"
```

#### VRF diagnostic loopback interfaces

The default interface description for VRF diagnostic loopbacks changes to `DIAG_VRF_<vrf>`. Previously the default description was `<vrf>_VTEP_DIAGNOSTICS`.

Setting the description directly on `loopback_description` defined under `vtep_diagnostic` still takes precedence.

The default descriptions can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+default_vrf_diag_loopback_description: "{vrf}_VTEP_DIAGNOSTICS"
```

The description fields support templates. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

#### Connected Endpoints ethernet interfaces

The default interface description for the connected endpoints changes to `<endpoint_type>_<endpoint>_<endpoint_port>`.
Previously the description was `<endpoint>_<endpoint_port>`.

Setting the description directly on the connected endpoint adapter still takes precedence.
The description fields support templates. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

The default descriptions can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+default_connected_endpoints_description: "{endpoint}{endpoint_port?<_}"
```

#### Connected Endpoints port-channel interfaces

The default interface description for the connected endpoints changes to `<endpoint_type>_<endpoint>_<endpoint_port_channel>`.
Previously the description was `<adapter_description or endpoint>_<port_channel_description>`, so the description field
set under `port_channel` was always added after the adapter description or name of the endpoint.

In AVD 5.0.0 setting the `description` key under `port_channel` of the adapter will replace the full port-channel interface description.
The description fields support templates. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

To retain the old descriptions, the value of the `description` key under `port_channel` must be *moved* to the new key
`endpoint_port_channel` for *all* adapters. Also the default description template must be updated.

```diff
 servers:
   - name: server01
     adapters:
       - <...>
         description: My adapter description
         port_channel:
-          description: My description that was added after the adapter description
+          endpoint_port_channel: My description that was added after the adapter description

+default_connected_endpoints_port_channel_description: "{adapter_description_or_endpoint}{endpoint_port_channel?<_}"
```

#### Network Ports ethernet interfaces

The default interface description for the `network_ports` data model changes to `<endpoint>`, allowing
to use new `endpoint` key under `network_ports` which is used similar to the endpoint name under connected endpoints.
Previously there was no default description.

Setting the description directly under `network_ports` still takes precedence.
The description fields support templates. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

The default descriptions can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+default_network_ports_description: ""
```

#### Network Ports port-channel interfaces

The default interface description for port-channels under the `network_ports` data model changes to `<endpoint>_<endpoint_port_channel>`,
allowing to use new `endpoint` key under `network_ports` which is used similarly to the endpoint name under connected endpoints.
Previously the description was `<network_port_description>_<port_channel_description>`, so the description field
set under `port_channel` was always added after the `description` set directly under the `network_ports`.

In AVD 5.0.0 setting the `description` key under `port_channel` of the network port will replace the full port-channel interface description.
The description fields support templates. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

To retain the old descriptions, the value of the `description` key under `port_channel` must be *moved* to the new key
`endpoint_port_channel` for *all* network_ports. Also the default description template must be updated.

```diff
 network_ports:
   - <...>
     description: My ports description
     port_channel:
-      description: My description that was added after the adapter description
+      endpoint_port_channel: My description that was added after the adapter description

+default_network_ports_port_channel_description: "{adapter_description_or_endpoint}{endpoint_port_channel?<_}"
```

#### MLAG peer-link ethernet interfaces

The interface description for the MLAG peer-link ethernet interfaces changes to `MLAG_{mlag_peer}_{peer_interface}`.
Previously the description was `MLAG_PEER_{mlag_peer}_{interface}` so using the local interface instead of the peer's. Most often the MLAG interfaces are the same, so this is a minor issue.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+mlag_member_description: "MLAG_PEER_{mlag_peer}_{interface}"
```

#### MLAG peer-link port-channel interfaces

The interface description for the MLAG peer-link port-channel interfaces changes to `MLAG_{mlag_peer}_{peer_interface}`.
Previously the description was `MLAG_PEER_{mlag_peer}_Po{mlag_port_channel_id}` so using the local port-channel ID instead of the peer's. Most often the MLAG interfaces are the same, so this is a minor issue.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+mlag_port_channel_description: "MLAG_PEER_{mlag_peer}_Po{mlag_port_channel_id}"
```

#### MLAG peer VLAN interface

The interface description for the MLAG peer SVI changes to `MLAG`. Previously the description was `MLAG_PEER`.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+mlag_peer_svi_description: "MLAG_PEER"
```

The description setting supports a template. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

#### MLAG L3 peering VLAN interface

The interface description for the MLAG L3 peering SVI changes to `MLAG_L3`. Previously the description was `MLAG_PEER_L3_PEERING`.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+mlag_peer_l3_svi_description: "MLAG_PEER_L3_PEERING"
```

The description setting supports a template. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

#### MLAG L3 VRF peering VLAN interface

The interface description for the MLAG L3 VRF peering SVI changes to `MLAG_L3_VRF_{vrf}`. Previously the description was `MLAG_PEER_L3_iBGP: vrf {vrf}`.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+mlag_peer_l3_vrf_svi_description: "MLAG_PEER_L3_iBGP: vrf {vrf}"
```

The description setting supports a template. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

### Default VLAN names are changed for more consistency

#### MLAG peer VLAN

The name of the MLAG peer VLAN (VLAN 4094 by default) changes to `MLAG`. Previously the name was `MLAG_PEER`.

The name can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+mlag_peer_vlan_name: "MLAG_PEER"
```

The setting supports a template. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

#### MLAG L3 peering VLAN

The name of the MLAG L3 peering VLAN (VLAN 4093 by default) changes to `MLAG_L3`. Previously the name was `LEAF_PEER_L3`.

The name can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+mlag_peer_l3_vlan_name: "LEAF_PEER_L3"
```

The setting supports a template. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

#### MLAG L3 VRF peering VLAN

The name of the MLAG L3 VRF peering VLAN changes to `MLAG_L3_VRF_{vrf}`. Previously the name was `MLAG_iBGP_{vrf}`.

The name can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+mlag_peer_l3_vrf_vlan_name: "MLAG_iBGP_{vrf}"
```

The setting supports a template. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

### Default BGP peer descriptions are changed for more consistency

#### MLAG L3 peering

The description of the MLAG L3 BGP peers, including those in VRFs, changes to `{mlag_peer}_{peer_interface}`. Previously the description was `{mlag_peer}`.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+mlag_bgp_peer_description: "{mlag_peer}"
```

The setting supports a template. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

#### Overlay peerings

The description of the overlay BGP peers (EVPN, MPLS, WAN) changes to `{peer}{peer_interface?<_}`. Previously the description was `{peer}`.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+overlay_bgp_peer_description: "{peer}"
```

The setting supports a template. See the input variables documentation for available fields.

### Combine the VLAN trunk groups used for MLAG

With AVD version 5.0.0 a single `MLAG` trunk group is used for MLAG and MLAG L3 peerings, including the peerings in VRFs.
Previously MLAG L3 peerings used a separate `LEAF_PEER_L3` trunk group.

The trunk group for MLAG L3 peerings can be reverted if needed:

```diff
+trunk_groups:
+  mlag_l3:
+    name: LEAF_PEER_L3
```

### `wan_mode: autovpn` renamed to `wan_mode: legacy-autovpn`

With AVD version 5.0.0 the valid values for `wan_mode` key have changed.
If using the `autovpn` mode in AVD 4.x, the `wan_mode` key needs to be updated to `legacy-autovpn`.

```diff
-  wan_mode: autovpn
+  wan_mode: legacy-autovpn
```

### custom_structured_configuration_prefix no longer accepts a string

Starting AVD 5.0.0, `custom_structured_configuration_prefix` only accepts a list of strings.
Previously it also accepted a string, which was autoconverted to a list.

```diff
- custom_structured_configuration_prefix: myprefix
+ custom_structured_configuration_prefix: ["myprefix"]
```

### default_overlay_address_families and overlay_address_families no longer accepts a string

Starting AVD 5.0.0, `node_type_keys[].default_overlay_address_families` and `<node_type_key>.defaults.overlay_address_families` only accept a list of strings.
Previously they also accepted a string, which was autoconverted to a list.

```diff
  node_type_keys:
    - key: my_node_type
      type: my_node_type
-     default_overlay_address_families: "evpn"
+     default_overlay_address_families: ["evpn"]

  <node_type_key - ex. l3leaf>:
    defaults:
-     overlay_address_families: "vpn-ipv4"
+     overlay_address_families: ["vpn-ipv4"]
    node_groups:
      - group: mygroup
-       overlay_address_families: "vpn-ipv4"
+       overlay_address_families: ["vpn-ipv4"]
        nodes:
          - name: leaf1

    nodes:
      - name: leaf2
-       overlay_address_families: "vpn-ipv6"
+       overlay_address_families: ["vpn-ipv6"]
```

#### mpls_route_servers no longer accepts a string

Starting AVD 5.0.0, `<node_type_key>.defaults.mpls_route_servers` only accepts a list of strings.
Previously it also accepted a string, which was autoconverted to a list.

```diff
  node_type_keys:
    - key: my_node_type
      type: my_node_type
-     mpls_route_servers: "10.10.10.10"
+     mpls_route_servers: ["10.10.10.10"]

  <node_type_key - ex. l3leaf>:
    defaults:
-     mpls_route_servers: "10.10.10.10"
+     mpls_route_servers: ["10.10.10.10"]
    node_groups:
      - group: mygroup
-       mpls_route_servers: "10.10.10.10"
+       mpls_route_servers: ["10.10.10.10"]
        nodes:
          - name: leaf1
-           mpls_route_servers: "20.20.20.20"
+           mpls_route_servers: ["20.20.20.20"]
    nodes:
      - name: leaf2
-       mpls_route_servers: "10.10.10.10"
+       mpls_route_servers: ["20.20.20.20"]
```

### `!RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista` is no longer at the top of the generated configurations

As of AVD 5.0.0 the `!RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista` line at the top of the configuration has been removed.

It can be added if required by using `config_comment`:

```diff
+config_comment: "RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista"
```

### Default value of `mlag_on_orphan_port_channel_downlink` is changed to `false`

The default value `true` of data model `mlag_on_orphan_port_channel_downlink` has been changed to `false`, so it is now required to set `mlag_on_orphan_port_channel_downlink: true` to configure the MLAG ID on a downlink Port-Channel even if the downlink is only on one node in the MLAG pair.
By default an MLAG ID will only be configured on Port-Channel downlinks dual-homed to two MLAG switches.

```diff
+ mlag_on_orphan_port_channel_downlink: true
```

### An error is raised if sFlow is enabled on an interface but `sflow_settings.destinations` is not set

In AVD 4.0.0, if `sflow` was enabled on an interface but `sflow_settings.destinations` was not defined, the sFlow configuration was still generated for interfaces, although it would not work without "custom structured configuration".

As of AVD 5.0.0, if `sflow` is enabled on an interface but `sflow_settings.destinations` is not set, an error is raised and the execution stops.

### Default value of `isis_system_id_format` is changed to `underlay_loopback`

In AVD 4.0.0, `node_id` was the default value of `isis_system_id_format`.
In AVD 5.0.0, this default value is changed to `underlay_loopback`.

To retain the previous behavior set the value back to `node_id`:

```diff
+isis_system_id_format: node_id
```

### Shutdown interfaces and BGP towards undeployed peers by default

In AVD 4.0.0, the default value of `shutdown_bgp_towards_undeployed_peers` and `shutdown_interfaces_towards_undeployed_peers` was `false`.
In AVD 5.0.0, the default value of `shutdown_bgp_towards_undeployed_peers` and `shutdown_interfaces_towards_undeployed_peers` is changed to `true`.

To retain the previous behaviour, set the value to `false`:

```diff
+shutdown_bgp_towards_undeployed_peers: false
+shutdown_interfaces_towards_undeployed_peers: false
```

### Only render IGMP snooping querier version and address when enabled

In AVD 4.0.0, the `ip igmp snooping vlan` command for version and address was rendered even when the IGMP snooping querier was not enabled.
Starting from AVD 5.0.0, the `ip igmp snooping vlan` command for version and address is rendered only when the IGMP snooping querier is enabled.

To retain the old configuration use custom structured configuration.

```diff
custom_structured_configuration_ip_igmp_snooping:
  vlans:
  - id: 1
    querier:
      enabled: false
      address: 192.168.255.1
      version: 3
```

### Default MTU value changed from `9214` to `9194` for Dps1, WAN HA and WAN p2p uplink interfaces

In AVD 4.0.0, the default MTU for Dps1, WAN HA and WAN p2p uplink interfaces was `9214`.
In AVD 5.0.0, the default MTU for Dps1, WAN HA and WAN p2p uplink interfaces has been changed to `9194`.

To retain the old MTU on WAN HA interfaces use `<node_type>.defaults/node_groups[]/node_groups[].nodes[]/nodes[].wan_ha.mtu` as `9214`.

```diff
wan_router:
  node_groups:
    - group: SITE_HA_ENABLED
      wan_ha:
        enabled: true
        ha_interfaces: [Ethernet52]
+       mtu: 9214
```

To retain the old MTU on Dps1 interface use custom structured configuration

```diff
custom_structured_configuration_dps_interfaces:
  - name: Dps1
+   mtu: 9214
```

To retain the old MTU on WAN p2p uplink interfaces use custom_platform_settings

```diff
custom_platform_settings:
  - feature_support:
      bgp_update_wait_for_convergence: true
      bgp_update_wait_install: false
      interface_storm_control: false
      queue_monitor_length_notify: false
    management_interface: Management1/1
+   p2p_uplinks_mtu: 9214
    platforms:
      - AWE-5310
      - AWE-5510
      - AWE-7250R
      - AWE-7230R
  - feature_support:
      bgp_update_wait_for_convergence: true
      bgp_update_wait_install: false
      interface_storm_control: false
      poe: true
      queue_monitor_length_notify: false
    management_interface: Management1
+   p2p_uplinks_mtu: 9214
    platforms:
      - AWE-7220R
```

#### Default encapsulation for WAN EVPN iBGP peerings changed to `path-selection`

With AVD version 5.0.0 the default encapsulation used for EVPN iBGP peering between WAN routers is `path-selection`. Previously it was `vxlan`.

!!! danger
    The `path-selection` encapsulation is only supported on EOS above 4.33.0F.

    It is critical that all WAN devices use the same encapsulation. For
    existing deployments it is recommended to set the encapsulation back to
    `vxlan` until a migration can be done across the entire WAN network.

    Contact your Arista account team for guidance on migration.

To retain the vxlan encapsulation on WAN EVPN iBGP peerings use `wan_encapsulation`:

```diff
+ wan_encapsulation: vxlan
```

### PREVIEW WAN HA Direct Link now uses Port-Channel by default

For WAN direct HA, AVD will now configure a port-channel by default. This feature was introduced in EOS 4.33.0F.

To retain the previous configuration use custom_platform_settings use `use_port_channel_for_direct_ha: false` under `wan_ha`.

```diff
  wan_router:
    node_groups:
      - group: Site42
        cv_pathfinder_region: AVD_Land_West
        cv_pathfinder_site: Site42
        wan_ha:
          enabled: true
+         use_port_channel_for_direct_ha: false
          ha_interfaces: [Ethernet52]
          ha_ipv4_pool: 10.10.10.0/24
```

### Prevent redistributing the MLAG peer link subnets into BGP for all VRFs by default

With AVD version 5.0.0 the subnet of VRF L3 peering VLANs between MLAG peers are no longer redistributed into BGP by default. Previously all connected routes were redistributed to BGP.

To retain the previous behavior, set `redistribute_mlag_ibgp_peering_vrfs` to `true` per tenant or VRF:

```diff
tenants:
  - name: Tenant_A
+   redistribute_mlag_ibgp_peering_vrfs: true
    <...>
    vrfs:
      - name: Tenant_A_OP
+       redistribute_mlag_ibgp_peering_vrfs: true
        <...>
```

## Changes to role `arista.avd.eos_cli_config_gen`

TODO: Level 3 sections for each change with details on how to migrate

### No auto-conversion of old data model for `router_bgp.redistribute_routes` and `router_bgp.vrfs[].redistribute_routes`

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs`, so action is only required when defining new interfaces
with `structured_config`, `custom_structured_configuration_`, or when using `eos_cli_config_gen` directly.

The data models for `router_bgp.redistribute_routes` and `router_bgp.vrfs[].redistribute_routes` previously supported either a list of strings or a dict-of-dicts.
In AVD 4.0.0 this was changed to a list-of-dicts with automatic conversion from any of the previous models into the new model.

As of AVD 5.0.0 the automatic conversion from both of the previous models has been removed, so it is required to update the input data to the new data models.

=== "Old data models"

    ```yaml
    # Old list data model
    router_bgp:
      redistribute_routes:
        - connected
        - static
      vrfs:
        - name: test
          redistribute_routes:
            - connected
            - static

    # Old dict-of-dicts data model
    router_bgp:
      redistribute_routes:
        connected:
          route_map: connected-to-bgp
        static:
          route_map: static-to-bgp
      vrfs:
        - name: test
          redistribute_routes:
            connected:
              route_map: connected-to-bgp
            static:
              route_map: static-to-bgp
    ```

=== "New data model"

    ```yaml
    # New data model
    router_bgp:
      redistribute_routes:
        - source_procol: connected
        - source_protocol: static
      vrfs:
        - name: test
          redistribute_routes:
            - source_procol: connected
            - source_protocol: static

    # New data model
    router_bgp:
      redistribute_routes:
        - source_protocol: connected
          route_map: connected-to-bgp
        - source_protocol: static
          route_map: static-to-bgp
      vrfs:
        - name: test
          redistribute_routes:
            - source_protocol: connected
              route_map: connected-to-bgp
            - source_protocol: static
              route_map: static-to-bgp
    ```

### Default EOS configuration is no longer automatically generated

The `generate_default_config` setting controls the generation of some default EOS configurations. This was previously set to `true` by default.

As of AVD 5.0.0 the default value of `generate_default_config` has been changed to `false` to prevent generation of any configuration not specified by the
inputs to `eos_cli_config_gen` (structured configuration).

The following commands will be generated when `generate_default_config` is set to `true`:

- RANCID Content Type
- Hostname
- Default configuration `no aaa root`
- Default configuration `no enable password`
- Transceiver qsfp default mode
- End of configuration delimiter

The setting `generate_default_config` will be removed in AVD 6.0.0.

The following `eos_cli_config_gen` inputs can be given as needed to generate the same configuration:

```diff
-generate_default_config: true
+aaa_root:
+  disabled: true
+config_comment: "RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista"
+config_end: true
+enable_password:
+  disabled: true
+hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
+transceiver_qsfp_default_mode_4x10: true
```

All changes except `"RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista"` have been incorporated into `eos_designs`. Action is only required when using `eos_cli_config_gen` directly,
or if the `RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista` is required.

### `monitor_sessions` no longer requires both `monitor_sessions.sources` and `monitor_sessions.destinations` to be defined for generating configuration

In AVD 4.0.0, `monitor_sessions` required both `monitor_sessions.sources` and `monitor_sessions.destinations` for configuration to be generated, but this is not required by EOS.

As of avd 5.0.0 `monitor_sessions` configuration will be generated even if `monitor_sessions.sources` or `monitor_sessions.destinations` are not defined. To revert this behavior update your inventory to remove the configuration.

### `router_isis.address_family_ipv4/6.enabled` is now required to generate the configuration and documentation for `router_isis` address-families

In AVD 4.0.0, the ISIS address-family configuration and documentation were generated independently of the `router_isis.address_family_ipv4/6.enabled` key.

As of AVD 5.0.0, `router_isis.address_family_ipv4/6.enabled` must be set to generate the configuration and documentation for `router_isis` address-families.

```diff
 router_isis:
   address_family_ipv4:
+    enabled: true
     <...>
   address_family_ipv6:
+    enabled: true
     <...>
```

### `ip_security.sa_policies[].esp.integrity` and `.encryption` "null" option has been replaced with "disabled"

In AVD 4.0.0 we had "null" as a valid value for esp integrity and encryption to apply the null security profile and encryption under the ip-security configuration.

As of AVD 5.0.0 "null" option for esp integrity and encryption has been replaced with "disabled" to apply the null security profile and encryption under the ip-security configuration.

```diff
 ip_security:
   sa_policies:
     name: Disabled
     esp:
-      integrity: "null"
-      encryption: "null"
+      integrity: disabled
+      encryption: disabled
```

### `router_ospf.redistribute.bgp/connected/static` data model has been updated to require the `enabled` key

To avoid ambiguous YAML data input, the data model for `router_ospf.redistribute.bgp/connected/static` has been updated to require the `enabled` key.

=== "4.x"

```yaml
router_ospf:
  process_ids:
    - id: 400
      redistribute:
        bgp: {}
        connected: {}
        static: {}
```

=== "5.x"

```yaml
router_ospf:
  process_ids:
    - id: 400
      redistribute:
        bgp:
         enabled: True
        connected:
         enabled: True
        static:
         enabled: True
```

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs`, so action is only required when defining `structured_configuration` directly.

### `router_traffic_engineering.enabled` is required

In AVD 4.0.0, setting `enabled: true` under `router_traffic_engineering` was not
required and it was possible to render

```eos
router traffic-engineering
```

using the following input

```yaml
router_traffic_engineering:
```

As of AVD 5.0.0, the `enabled` keyword is required under `router_traffic_engineering`:

```yaml
router_traffic_engineering:
  enabled: true
```

### Removal of default type `switched` from ethernet interfaces and port-channel interfaces

In AVD 4.0.0, we had "switched" as the default value for `ethernet_interfaces[].type` and `port_channel_interfaces[].type`.

With AVD 5.0.0, the default value for `type` in `ethernet_interfaces` and `port_channel_interfaces` is no longer supported. The `type` key must now be explicitly defined in the input variables if it is needed in the configuration and documentation.

### Removal of `type` key dependency for rendering ethernet/port-channel interfaces configuration and documentation

#### `vlan_id` configuration

In AVD 4.0.0, the configuration for `vlan_id` in ethernet interfaces and port-channel interfaces was rendered only if `ethernet_interfaces[].type` or `port_channel_interfaces[].type` was set to `l2dot1q`.

With AVD 5.0.0, the dependency on the `type` key for rendering the configuration of `vlan_id` in ethernet and port-channel interfaces has been removed.

```diff
 ethernet_interfaces:
   - name: Ethernet1.10
-    type: l2dot1q
     vlan_id: 10
!
 port_channel_interfaces:
   - name: Port-Channel1.10
-    type: l2dot1q
     vlan_id: 10

#### `switchport` configuration and documentation

In AVD 4.0.0, the configuration and documentation for `switchport` in ethernet and port-channel interfaces were renderend only if `ethernet_interfaces[].type` or `port_channel_interfaces[].type` was set to `switched` along with the keys `mode`, `vlans`, `native_vlan`, `native_vlan_tag`, `trunk_groups`, `phone`, `vlan_translations`, `trunk_private_vlan_secondary`, `pvlan_mapping`.
The `no switchport` command was renderend if `ethernet_interfaces[].type` or `port_channel_interfaces[].type` was set to `routed`.

With AVD 5.0.0, a new key for `switchport` has been introduced under ethernet and port-channel interfaces data-model, which generates the configuration and documentation for `switchport` independent of the `type` key.
The keys `mode`, `vlans`, `native_vlan`, `native_vlan_tag`, `trunk_groups`, `phone`, `vlan_translations`, `trunk_private_vlan_secondary`, `pvlan_mapping` are deprecated, to be removed in AVD 6.0.0.

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs`, so action is only required when defining `structured_configuration` directly.

#### `encapsulation` configuration and documentation

In AVD 4.0.0, the configuration and documentation for `encapsulation` in ethernet and port-channel interfaces were renderend only if `ethernet_interfaces[].type` or `port_channel_interfaces[].type` was set to `l2dot1q/l3dot1q` along with the keys `encapsulation_dot1q_vlan` and `encapsulation_vlan`.

With AVD 5.0.0, a new key for `encapsulation_dot1q` has been introduced and the schema for `encapsulation_vlan` has been modified under ethernet and port-channel interfaces data-model, which generates the configuration and documentation for `encapsulation` independent of the `type` key.
The keys `encapsulation_dot1q_vlan`, `encapsulation_vlan.client.dot1q`, `encapsulation_vlan.client.unmatched`, `encapsulation_vlan.network.dot1q` and `encapsulation_vlan.network.client` are deprecated, to be removed in AVD 6.0.0.

```diff
ethernet_interfaces:
  - name: Ethernet1.20

### Data models for BGP additional-paths under `router_bgp` has been changed

In AVD 5.0.0, the following data models have been changed and will require updates to the inventory:

- `router_bgp.vrfs[].address_family_ipv4.bgp.additional_paths`
- `router_bgp.vrf[].address_family_ipv6.bgp.additional_paths`
- `router_bgp.address_family_evpn.bgp.peer_groups[].additional_paths`
- `router_bgp.address_family_evpn.bgp_additional_paths`
- `router_bgp.address_family_path_selection.bgp.additional_paths`
- `router_bgp.address_family_path_selection.neighbors[].additional_paths`

The key `additional_paths.send` is a now a string instead of dictionary, and extra keys have been added for the various related arguments.

The difference shown below keeps the previous configurations.

```diff
router_bgp:
  address_family_path_selection:
    bgp:
      additional_paths:
-        send:
-          any: true
+        send: any
  <...>
  vrfs:
    address_family_ipv4:
      bgp:

+          send_limit: 100
  <...>
    address_family_ipv6:
      bgp:
        additional_paths:
-         send:
-           limit: 100
+         send: limit
+         send_limit: 100
  <...>
    address_family_evpn:
      bgp_additional_paths:
        receive: true
-       send:
-         ecmp
+       send: ecmp
      peer_groups:
        additional_paths:
-         send:
-           any: false
+         send: disabled
```

### Fix issues with flags, source/destination ports, and field set for TCP/UDP protocol under traffic-policies

The change has been incorporated into `traffic-policies.j2` eos template.

In AVD 4.0.0, configuring the `flags` for `UDP` protocol under traffic-policies was allowed and the configuration for `source/destination port` and `source/destination field-set` together was not generated for `TCP/UDP` protocol.

As of AVD 5.0.0, the configuration of `flags` in `UDP` protocol under traffic-policies is not generated and the configuration for `source/destination port` and `field set` can be generated together for `TCP/UDP` protocol. Also, the configuration order has been fixed as per the EOS running-config.

### Removal of deprecated data models

The following data model keys have been removed from `eos_cli_config_gen` in v5.0.0.

## Changes to role `arista.avd.eos_validate_state`

### Input for hardware tests have been updated

The inputs for the hardware test have changed.

```yaml
validation_role:
  xcvr_own_manufacturers:
    - Manufacturer 1
    - Manufacturer 2
  pwr_supply_states:
     - ok
     - notInserted
  fan_states:
     - ok
     - notInserted
```

should be replaced with:

```yaml
accepted_xcvr_manufacturers:
  - Manufacturer 1
  - Manufacturer 2
accepted_pwr_supply_states:
  - ok
  - notInserted
accepted_fan_states:
  - ok
  - notInserted
```

### Filtering tests using Ansible tags support was removed

The filtering of tests using Ansible tags has been removed, The `skip_tests` variable should be used instead. The `skip_tests` mechanism is much more granular and allow to filter at the test level.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/fabric-validate.yaml --skip-tags ntp,bgp_checks
```

should be replaced with the following input variables:

```yaml
skip_tests:
 - category: AvdTestNTP
 - category: AvdTestBGP
```

and the following command line:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/fabric-validate.yaml
```

The test categories are listed in the [role documentation](../../roles/eos_validate_state/README.md#test-categories)
