# Porting Guide for Ansible AVD 5.x.x

Major releases of AVD can contain breaking changes. This porting guide addresses how to update your inventory
and playbooks to be compatible with new default behaviors and changed data models when upgrading from AVD 4.x versions.

!!! note
    To upgrade from AVD version 3.x, first upgrade to AVD 4.10 using the [Porting Guide for Ansible AVD 4.x.x](https://avd.arista.com/4.10/docs/porting-guides/4.x.x.html)
    and then upgrade to 5.x with this guide.

Users of `eos_designs` do not have to consider the changes in `eos_cli_config_gen`, since those adaptions are
built into `eos_designs`.

## Common changes

### Data model changes from "dict-of-dicts" to "list-of-dicts"

In AVD 4.0.0 and across both `eos_designs` and `eos_cli_config_gen`, *all* "dict-of-dicts" data models with user-defined keys were changed to "list-of-dicts".
In AVD 4.x inputs were auto-converted to the new data models.

As of AVD 5.0.0 the automatic conversion from dict-of-dicts has been removed, so it is required to update the input data to the new data models.
The `avd_data_conversion_mode` key has also been removed.

Errors will be raised for each data model not conforming to the list type when running AVD:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml
<...>
ERROR! [host1]: 'Validation Error: access_lists': {'ACL-01': {'sequence_numbers': {10: {'actio<...abbreviated...>4 any'}}}} is not of type 'list'
```

As an example, `ethernet_interfaces` was changed from:

```yaml
ethernet_intefaces:
  Ethernet1:   # <-- User defined key
    <...>
```

to:

```yaml
ethernet_interfaces:
  - name: Ethernet1   # <-- "name" here is called the "primary_key" which must have a unique value across all list elements
    <...>
```

## Removal of Ansible plugins

The following ansible plugins have been removed from the `arista.avd` Ansible collection in v5.0.0.

| Plugin type | Plugin name | Replacement |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Filter | `arista.avd.convert_dicts` | The internal `arista.avd.convert_dicts` filter plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |
| Filter | `arista.avd.hash_passphrase` | Use `arista.avd.snmp_hash` instead. |
| Filter | `arista.avd.generate_esi` | Use Jinja string concatenation instead like `{{ <esi_prefix> ~ <short_esi> }}`. |
| Filter | `arista.avd.generate_lacp_id` | Use the builtin `replace` filter instead like `{{ <short_esi> \| replace(':', '.') }}`. |
| Filter | `arista.avd.generate_route_target` | Use the builtin `ansible.builtin.regex_replace` filter instead like `{{ <short_esi> \| ansible.builtin.regex_replace('(\\d{2})(\\d{2}):(\\d{2})(\\d{2}):(\\d{2})(\\d{2})', '\\1:\\2:\\3:\\4:\\5:\\6') }}`. |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd.deploy_to_cv` | Use `arista.avd.cv_workflow` instead. |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd.batch_template` | The internal `arista.avd.batch_template` action plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd.validate_and_template` | The internal `arista.avd.validate_and_template` action plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd.yaml_templates_to_facts` | The internal `arista.avd.yaml_templates_to_facts` action plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd._emit_warning` | The internal `arista.avd._emit_warning` action plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |

## Changes to role arista.avd.eos_designs

TODO: Level 3 sections for each change with details on how to migrate

### Removed `redistribute igmp` from BGP vlan config belonging to a VRF with evpn multicast

AVD versions below 5.0.0 configures `redistribute igmp` under BGP for all SVIs when `evpn_l2_multicast` is True but configuring `redistribute igmp` with both L2 and L3 EVPN Multicast enabled will take up additional control-plane and data-plane resources.

In AVD version 5.0.0 by default `redistribute igmp` is only configured when `evpn_l2_multicast` is True and `evpn_l3_multicast` for the VRF is False.
In order to retain the previous behavior for SVIs under BGP where both `evpn_l2_multicast` and `evpn_l3_multicast` are enabled set `always_redistribute_igmp` key to True either for all SVIs within the Tenant or for each SVIs individually.

```diff
tenants:
  - name: Tenant_B
    evpn_l3_multicast:
      enabled: true
      <...>
    evpn_l2_multicast:
      enabled: true
+     always_redistribute_igmp: true
      <...>
  - name: Tenant_C
    evpn_l3_multicast:
      enabled: true
      <...>
    evpn_l2_multicast:
      enabled: true
      <...>
    vrfs:
      - name: TEN_C_L3_MULTICAST_ENABLED
        svis:
          - id: 136
            name: "L3_L2_MULTICAST_ENABLED_136"
            evpn_l2_multicast:
+             always_redistribute_igmp: true
```

### Base class for custom IP addressing `AvdIpAddressing` was moved

The `AvdIpAddressing` class was moved from the Ansible collection to `pyavd.api.ip_addressing`. Import statements must be updated.

```diff
- from ansible_collections.arista.avd.roles.eos_designs.python_modules.ip_addressing import AvdIpAddressing
+ from pyavd.api.ip_addressing import AvdIpAddressing
```

### Base class for custom interface descriptions `AvdInterfaceDescriptions` breaking changes

The `AvdInterfaceDescriptions` class and the associated `InterfaceDescriptionData` data class were moved from the Ansible collection
to `pyavd.api.interface_descriptions`. Import statements must be updated.

```diff
- from ansible_collections.arista.avd.roles.eos_designs.python_modules.interface_descriptions import AvdInterfaceDescriptions, InterfaceDescriptionData
+ from pyavd.api.interface_descriptions import AvdInterfaceDescriptions, InterfaceDescriptionData
```

Some methods of the `AvdInterfaceDescriptions` class were collapsed.
The following table indicates the removed methods and the replacement ones to
adjust the code. Note that the new method signatures are different.

| Removed method signature | Replacement method signature |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `underlay_ethernet_interfaces(self, link_type: str, link_peer: str, link_peer_interface: str) -> str` | `underlay_ethernet_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `underlay_port_channel_interfaces(self, link_peer: str, link_peer_channel_group_id: int, link_channel_description: str) -> str:` | `underlay_port_channel_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `mlag_ethernet_interfaces(self, mlag_interface: str) -> str:` | `mlag_ethernet_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `mlag_port_channel_interfaces(self) -> str:` | `mlag_ethernet_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `connected_endpoints_ethernet_interfaces(self, peer: str = None, peer_interface: str = None, adapter_description: str = None) -> str:` | `connected_endpoint_ethernet_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `connected_endpoints_port_channel_interfaces(self, peer: str = None, adapter_description: str = None, adapter_port_channel_description: str = None) -> str:` | `connected_endpoint_port_channel_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `overlay_loopback_interface(self, overlay_loopback_description: str = None) -> str` | `router_id_loopback_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |
| `vtep_loopback_interface(self) -> str` | `vtep_loopback_interface(self, data: InterfaceDescriptionData) -> str` |

For any method that was not previously overwritten, there should be no output change as compared to AVD 4.10.0.

### Removal of deprecated data models

The following data model keys have been removed from `eos_designs` in v5.0.0.

| Removed key | New key |
| ----------- | ------- |
| cvp_instance_ip | cvp_instance_ips |
| <connected_endpoints_key>[].adapters[].port_channel.short_esi | <connected_endpoints_key>[].adapters[].ethernet_segment.short_esi |
| network_ports[].port_channel.short_esi | network_ports[].ethernet_segment.short_esi |
| port_profiles[].port_channel.short_esi | port_profiles[].ethernet_segment.short_esi |

### The default platform settings for R3-series now have the TCAM profile "vxlan-routing"

Starting AVD 5.0.0, the default platform settings for `7280R3`, `7500R3` and `7800R3` platforms now contain `tcam_profile: vxlan-routing`
This change is based on a new Arista best practice for VXLAN deployments with the R3-series.
Not using this TCAM profile can lead to incorrect handling of VXLAN IPv6 NS packets.

!!! warning
    Since applying a TCAM profile will cause reprogramming of the forwarding processor, it can lead to disturbances to the network services.

    Please work with your Arista account team to decide if the new default is the right choice for your network, and how to apply it.

To retain the old configuration with no TCAM profile the default platform settings can be overridden with the new `custom_platform_settings` key:

```diff
+custom_platform_settings:
+  - platforms:
+      - 7280R3
+    reload_delay:
+      mlag: 900
+      non_mlag: 1020
+  - platforms:
+      - 7500R3
+      - 7800R3
+    management_interface: Management0
+    reload_delay:
+      mlag: 900
+      non_mlag: 1020
```

### Structured Configuration merged from SVI profiles is now deep merged instead of replaced

When merging `structured_config` from SVI profiles and parent profiles, AVD versions below 5.0.0 replaced the entire `structured_config` object with the most specific definition of `structured_config`.

With AVD version 5.0.0 `structured_config` is now deep-merged, same as for other profiles in AVD. This allows the user to contribute different parts of the `structured_config` from profiles or parent profiles.

Example:

```yaml
svi_profiles:
  - name: TEST1
    parent_profile: TEST2
    structured_config:
      no_autostate: true
  - name: TEST2
    structured_config:
      description: foo

tenants:
  - name: mytenant
    vrfs:
      - name: myvrf
        svis:
          - id: 10
            profile: TEST1
            structured_config:
              no_autostate: false

```

With AVD versions below 5.0.0 this produced an effective `structured_config` for SVI 10 of:

```yaml
no_autostate: false
```

Only the most specific entry got applied.

With AVD version 5.0.0 the same inputs will produce an effective `structured_config` for SVI 10 of:

```yaml
description: foo      # <-- Inherited from profile which inherited from parent_profile
no_autostate: false   # <-- Set on SVI, overriding the setting from svi_profile
```

Depending on the complexity of the deployment, it may require changes to the SVI and profiles to retain the previous configuration output.

### MLAG L3 Peering VLAN 4093 is no longer created when `underlay_routing_protocol: 'none'`

AVD versions below 5.0.0 created the MLAG L3 peering VLAN 4093, even when no L3 MLAG peering was created using an underlay routing protocol.
This happened in cases where `underlay_routing_protocol` was set to `none`.

In AVD version 5.0.0 the MLAG L3 peering VLAN 4093 is not longer created when `underlay_routing_protocol` is `'none'`.
Instead an MLAG peering VLAN will be created for VRF `default`, if it is defined under network services, using the same MLAG peer VLAN logic as for
other VRFs; `<mlag_ibgp_peering_vrfs.base_vlan - default 3000> - 1 + <vrf_id>`.

The peer VLAN config can be retained by setting `mlag_ibgp_peering_vlan: 4093` under the VRF, by using `custom_structured_configuration` or by setting `underlay_routing_protocol` to something else than `none`.

### BGP is now configured for Network services VRFs even if 'evpn' is not part of the address-families

AVD versions below 5.0.0 did not generate BGP configuration for VRFs unless the node type included `evpn` or `mpls` under `default_address_families` *and* the
VRF had the same `evpn` or `mpls` defined under `address_families` (default is `['evpn']`).

AVD version 4.6.0 introduced the toggle `new_network_services_bgp_vrf_config: <bool; default=false>` to change this behavior by no longer requiring `evpn`
in the address-families, but instead it always configured BGP for all VRFs. This toggle has been removed in AVD 5.0.0 since this is now part of the default
behavior.

With AVD version 5.0.0, the logic of whether to configure BGP for a network services VRF has been improved with the following rules:

- **New**: Always/never configure BGP for the VRF according to the new optional `bgp.enabled` setting. This takes precedence over all other rules.
- **Existing**: If the VRF is part of an overlay (`evpn` or `mpls`), BGP will be configured for the VRF.
- **New**: If any BGP peers are configured under the VRF, BGP will be configured for the VRF. This is useful for L2LS designs with VRFs.
- **Improved**: If uplink type is `p2p-vrfs` *and* the VRF is included in the uplink VRFs, BGP will be configured for the VRF.

It is possible to forcefully add or remove BGP configuration per VRF by setting:

```yaml
<network_services_key e.g. tenants>:
  - name: mytenant
    vrfs:
      - name: myvrf
        bgp:
          enabled: <bool>  # <-- New optional setting to either always or never configure BGP for the VRF
```

### Default interface descriptions are changed for more consistency

With AVD version 5.0.0 the default interface descriptions are changed to give better consistency.

The interface description for `Loopback0` changes to `ROUTER_ID` for all designs.
Previously this description varied depending on the network design and chosen protocols.

The `router_id_loopback_description` or the deprecated `overlay_loopback_description` settings still takes precedence,
so no changes will be seen if either of these are set.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
 # Using the new 'router_id_loopback_description' which replaces the deprecated 'overlay_loopback_description'
+router_id_loopback_description: "EVPN_Overlay_Peering"
```

The interface description for `Loopback1` (or the interface set with `vtep_loopback`) changes to `VXLAN_TUNNEL_SOURCE`.
Previously the description was `VTEP_VXLAN_Tunnel_Source`.

The description can be reverted manually if needed:

```diff
+vtep_loopback_description: "VTEP_VXLAN_Tunnel_Source"
```

### custom_structured_configuration_prefix no longer accepts a string

Starting AVD 5.0.0, `custom_structured_configuration_prefix` only accepts a list of strings.
Previously it also accepted a string, which was autoconverted to a list.

```diff
- custom_structured_configuration_prefix: myprefix
+ custom_structured_configuration_prefix: ["myprefix"]
```

### default_overlay_address_families and overlay_address_families no longer accepts a string

Starting AVD 5.0.0, `node_type_keys[].default_overlay_address_families` and `<node_type_key>.defaults.overlay_address_families` only accept a list of strings.
Previously they also accepted a string, which was autoconverted to a list.

```diff
  node_type_keys:
    - key: my_node_type
      type: my_node_type
-     default_overlay_address_families: "evpn"
+     default_overlay_address_families: ["evpn"]

  <node_type_key - ex. l3leaf>:
    defaults:
-     overlay_address_families: "vpn-ipv4"
+     overlay_address_families: ["vpn-ipv4"]
    node_groups:
      - group: mygroup
-       overlay_address_families: "vpn-ipv4"
+       overlay_address_families: ["vpn-ipv4"]
        nodes:
          - name: leaf1
-           overlay_address_families: "vpn-ipv6"
+           overlay_address_families: ["vpn-ipv6"]
    nodes:
      - name: leaf2
-       overlay_address_families: "vpn-ipv6"
+       overlay_address_families: ["vpn-ipv6"]
```

#### mpls_route_servers no longer accepts a string

Starting AVD 5.0.0, `<node_type_key>.defaults.mpls_route_servers` only accepts a list of strings.
Previously it also accepted a string, which was autoconverted to a list.

```diff
  node_type_keys:
    - key: my_node_type
      type: my_node_type
-     mpls_route_servers: "10.10.10.10"
+     mpls_route_servers: ["10.10.10.10"]

  <node_type_key - ex. l3leaf>:
    defaults:
-     mpls_route_servers: "10.10.10.10"
+     mpls_route_servers: ["10.10.10.10"]
    node_groups:
      - group: mygroup
-       mpls_route_servers: "10.10.10.10"
+       mpls_route_servers: ["10.10.10.10"]
        nodes:
          - name: leaf1
-           mpls_route_servers: "20.20.20.20"
+           mpls_route_servers: ["20.20.20.20"]
    nodes:
      - name: leaf2
-       mpls_route_servers: "10.10.10.10"
+       mpls_route_servers: ["20.20.20.20"]
```

### `!RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista` is no longer at the top of the generated configurations

As of AVD 5.0.0 the `!RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista` line at the top of the configuration has been removed.

It can be added if required by using `config_comment`:

```diff
+config_comment: "RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista"
```

### Default value of `mlag_on_orphan_port_channel_downlink` is changed to `false`

The default value `true` of data model `mlag_on_orphan_port_channel_downlink` has been changed to `false`, so it is now required to set `mlag_on_orphan_port_channel_downlink: true` to configure the MLAG ID on a downlink Port-Channel even if the downlink is only on one node in the MLAG pair.
By default an MLAG ID will only be configured on Port-Channel downlinks dual-homed to two MLAG switches.

```diff
+ mlag_on_orphan_port_channel_downlink: true
```

### An error is raised if sFlow is enabled on an interface but `sflow_settings.destinations` is not set

In AVD 4.0.0, if `sflow` was enabled on an interface but `sflow_settings.destinations` was not defined, the sFlow configuration was still generated for interfaces, although it would not work without "custom structured configuration".

As of AVD 5.0.0, if `sflow` is enabled on an interface but `sflow_settings.destinations` is not set, an error is raised and the execution stops.

### Default value of `isis_system_id_format` is changed to `underlay_loopback`

In AVD 4.0.0, `node_id` was the default value of `isis_system_id_format`.
In AVD 5.0.0, this default value is changed to `underlay_loopback`.

To retain the previous behavior set the value back to `node_id`:

```diff
+isis_system_id_format: node_id
```

### Shutdown interfaces and BGP towards undeployed peers by default

In AVD 4.0.0, the default value of `shutdown_bgp_towards_undeployed_peers` and `shutdown_interfaces_towards_undeployed_peers` was `false`.
In AVD 5.0.0, the default value of `shutdown_bgp_towards_undeployed_peers` and `shutdown_interfaces_towards_undeployed_peers` is changed to `true`.

To retain the previous behaviour, set the value to `false`:

```diff
+shutdown_bgp_towards_undeployed_peers: false
+shutdown_interfaces_towards_undeployed_peers: false
```

### Default MTU value changed from `9214` to `9194` for Dps1, WAN HA and WAN p2p uplink interfaces

In AVD 4.0.0, the default MTU for Dps1, WAN HA and WAN p2p uplink interfaces was `9214`.
In AVD 5.0.0, the default MTU for Dps1, WAN HA and WAN p2p uplink interfaces has been changed to `9194`.

To retain the old MTU on WAN HA interfaces use `<node_type>.defaults/node_groups[]/node_groups[].nodes[]/nodes[].wan_ha.mtu` as `9214`.

```diff
wan_router:
  node_groups:
    - group: SITE_HA_ENABLED
      wan_ha:
        enabled: true
        ha_interfaces: [Ethernet52]
+       mtu: 9214
```

To retain the old MTU on Dps1 interface use custom structured configuration

```diff
custom_structured_configuration_dps_interfaces:
  - name: Dps1
+   mtu: 9214
```

To retain the old MTU on WAN p2p uplink interfaces use custom_platform_settings

```diff
custom_platform_settings:
  - feature_support:
      bgp_update_wait_for_convergence: true
      bgp_update_wait_install: false
      interface_storm_control: false
      queue_monitor_length_notify: false
    management_interface: Management1/1

## Changes to role `arista.avd.eos_cli_config_gen`

TODO: Level 3 sections for each change with details on how to migrate

### No auto-conversion of old data model for `router_bgp.redistribute_routes` and `router_bgp.vrfs[].redistribute_routes`

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs`, so action is only required when defining new interfaces
with `structured_config`, `custom_structured_configuration_`, or when using `eos_cli_config_gen` directly.

The data models for `router_bgp.redistribute_routes` and `router_bgp.vrfs[].redistribute_routes` previously supported either a list of strings or a dict-of-dicts.
In AVD 4.0.0 this was changed to a list-of-dicts with automatic conversion from any of the previous models into the new model.

As of AVD 5.0.0 the automatic conversion from both of the previous models has been removed, so it is required to update the input data to the new data models.

=== "Old data models"

    ```yaml
    # Old list data model

### Default EOS configuration is no longer automatically generated

The `generate_default_config` setting controls the generation of some default EOS configurations. This was previously set to `true` by default.

As of AVD 5.0.0 the default value of `generate_default_config` has been changed to `false` to prevent generation of any configuration not specified by the
inputs to `eos_cli_config_gen` (structured configuration).

The following commands will be generated when `generate_default_config` is set to `true`:

- RANCID Content Type
- Hostname
- Default configuration `no aaa root`
- Default configuration `no enable password`
- Transceiver qsfp default mode
- End of configuration delimiter

The setting `generate_default_config` will be removed in AVD 6.0.0.

The following `eos_cli_config_gen` inputs can be given as needed to generate the same configuration:

```diff
-generate_default_config: true
+aaa_root:
+  disabled: true
+config_comment: "RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista"
+config_end: true
+enable_password:
+  disabled: true
+hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
+transceiver_qsfp_default_mode_4x10: true
```

All changes except `"RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista"` have been incorporated into `eos_designs`. Action is only required when using `eos_cli_config_gen` directly,
or if the `RANCID-CONTENT-TYPE: arista` is required.

### `router_isis.address_family_ipv4/6.enabled` is now required to generate the configuration and documentation for `router_isis` address-families

In AVD 4.0.0, the ISIS address-family configuration and documentation were generated independently of the `router_isis.address_family_ipv4/6.enabled` key.

As of AVD 5.0.0, `router_isis.address_family_ipv4/6.enabled` must be set to generate the configuration and documentation for `router_isis` address-families.

```diff
 router_isis:
   address_family_ipv4:
+    enabled: true
     <...>
   address_family_ipv6:
+    enabled: true
     <...>
```

### `ip_security.sa_policies[].esp.integrity` and `.encryption` "null" option has been replaced with "disabled"

In AVD 4.0.0 we had "null" as a valid value for esp integrity and encryption to apply the null security profile and encryption under the ip-security configuration.

As of AVD 5.0.0 "null" option for esp integrity and encryption has been replaced with "disabled" to apply the null security profile and encryption under the ip-security configuration.

```diff
 ip_security:
   sa_policies:
     name: Disabled
     esp:
-      integrity: "null"
-      encryption: "null"
+      integrity: disabled
+      encryption: disabled
```

### `router_ospf.redistribute.bgp/connected/static` data model has been updated to require the `enabled` key

To avoid ambiguous YAML data input, the data model for `router_ospf.redistribute.bgp/connected/static` has been updated to require the `enabled` key.

=== "4.x"

```yaml
router_ospf:
  process_ids:
    - id: 400
      redistribute:
        bgp: {}
        connected: {}
        static: {}
```

=== "5.x"

```yaml
router_ospf:
  process_ids:
    - id: 400
      redistribute:
        bgp:
         enabled: True
        connected:
         enabled: True
        static:
         enabled: True
```

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs`, so action is only required when defining `structured_configuration` directly.

### `router_traffic_engineering.enabled` is required

In AVD 4.0.0, setting `enabled: true` under `router_traffic_engineering` was not
required and it was possible to render

```eos
router traffic-engineering
```

using the following input

```yaml
router_traffic_engineering:
```

As of AVD 5.0.0, the `enabled` keyword is required under `router_traffic_engineering`:

```yaml
router_traffic_engineering:
  enabled: true
```

### Removal of default type `switched` from ethernet interfaces and port-channel interfaces

In AVD 4.0.0, we had "switched" as the default value for `ethernet_interfaces[].type` and `port_channel_interfaces[].type`.

With AVD 5.0.0, the default value for `type` in `ethernet_interfaces` and `port_channel_interfaces` is no longer supported. The `type` key must now be explicitly defined in the input variables if it is needed in the configuration and documentation.

### Removal of `type` key dependency for rendering ethernet/port-channel interfaces configuration and documentation

#### `vlan_id` configuration

In AVD 4.0.0, the configuration for `vlan_id` in ethernet interfaces and port-channel interfaces was rendered only if `ethernet_interfaces[].type` or `port_channel_interfaces[].type` was set to `l2dot1q`.

With AVD 5.0.0, the dependency on the `type` key for rendering the configuration of `vlan_id` in ethernet and port-channel interfaces has been removed.

```diff
 ethernet_interfaces:
   - name: Ethernet1.10
-    type: l2dot1q
     vlan_id: 10
!
 port_channel_interfaces:
   - name: Port-Channel1.10
-    type: l2dot1q
     vlan_id: 10
```

#### `switchport` configuration and documentation

In AVD 4.0.0, the configuration and documentation for `switchport` in ethernet and port-channel interfaces were renderend only if `ethernet_interfaces[].type` or `port_channel_interfaces[].type` was set to `switched` along with the keys `mode`, `vlans`, `native_vlan`, `native_vlan_tag`, `trunk_groups`, `phone`, `vlan_translations`, `trunk_private_vlan_secondary`, `pvlan_mapping`.
The `no switchport` command was renderend if `ethernet_interfaces[].type` or `port_channel_interfaces[].type` was set to `routed`.

With AVD 5.0.0, a new key for `switchport` has been introduced under ethernet and port-channel interfaces data-model, which generates the configuration and documentation for `switchport` independent of the `type` key.
The keys `mode`, `vlans`, `native_vlan`, `native_vlan_tag`, `trunk_groups`, `phone`, `vlan_translations`, `trunk_private_vlan_secondary`, `pvlan_mapping` are deprecated, to be removed in AVD 6.0.0.

+       direction_both:

+           to: 5
```

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs`, so action is only required when defining `structured_configuration` directly.

#### `encapsulation` configuration and documentation

In AVD 4.0.0, the configuration and documentation for `encapsulation` in ethernet and port-channel interfaces were renderend only if `ethernet_interfaces[].type` or `port_channel_interfaces[].type` was set to `l2dot1q/l3dot1q` along with the keys `encapsulation_dot1q_vlan` and `encapsulation_vlan`.

With AVD 5.0.0, a new key for `encapsulation_dot1q` has been introduced and the schema for `encapsulation_vlan` has been modified under ethernet and port-channel interfaces data-model, which generates the configuration and documentation for `encapsulation` independent of the `type` key.
The keys `encapsulation_dot1q_vlan`, `encapsulation_vlan.client.dot1q`, `encapsulation_vlan.client.unmatched`, `encapsulation_vlan.network.dot1q` and `encapsulation_vlan.network.client` are deprecated, to be removed in AVD 6.0.0.

```diff

## Changes to role `arista.avd.eos_validate_state`

### Input for hardware tests have been updated

The inputs for the hardware test have changed.

```yaml
validation_role:
  xcvr_own_manufacturers:
    - Manufacturer 1
    - Manufacturer 2
  pwr_supply_states:
     - ok
     - notInserted
  fan_states:
     - ok
     - notInserted
```

should be replaced with:

```yaml
accepted_xcvr_manufacturers:
  - Manufacturer 1
  - Manufacturer 2
accepted_pwr_supply_states:
  - ok
  - notInserted
accepted_fan_states:
  - ok
  - notInserted
```

### Filtering tests using Ansible tags support was removed

The filtering of tests using Ansible tags has been removed, The `skip_tests` variable should be used instead. The `skip_tests` mechanism is much more granular and allow to filter at the test level.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/fabric-validate.yaml --skip-tags ntp,bgp_checks
```

should be replaced with the following input variables:

```yaml
skip_tests:
 - category: AvdTestNTP
 - category: AvdTestBGP
```

and the following command line:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/fabric-validate.yaml
```

The test categories are listed in the [role documentation](../../roles/eos_validate_state/README.md#test-categories)
