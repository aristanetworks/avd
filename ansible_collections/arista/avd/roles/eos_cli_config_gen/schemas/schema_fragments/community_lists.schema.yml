    description: |
      AVD supports 2 different data models for community lists:

      - The legacy `community_lists` data model that can be used for compatibility with the existing deployments.
      - The improved `ip_community_lists` data model.

      Both data models can coexist without conflicts, as different keys are used: `community_lists` vs `ip_community_lists`.
      Community list names must be unique.

      The legacy data model supports simplified community list definition that only allows a single action to be defined as string:
    items:
      type: dict
      keys:
        name:
          type: str
          required: true
          description: Community-list Name
        action:
          type: str
          required: true
          description: |
            Action as string
            Example: "permit GSHUT 65123:123"
