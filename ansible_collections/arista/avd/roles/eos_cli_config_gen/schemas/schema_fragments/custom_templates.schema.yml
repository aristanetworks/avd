      - Custom templates can be added below the playbook directory.
      - If a location above the directory is desired, a symbolic link can be used.
      - Example under the `playbooks` directory create symbolic link with the following command:

        ```bash
        ln -s ../../shared_repo/custom_avd_templates/ ./custom_avd_templates
        ```

      - The output will be rendered at the end of the configuration.

      - It is recommended to use a `!` delimiter at the top of each custom template.

      Add `custom_templates` to group/host variables:
