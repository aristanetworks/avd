      AVD supports 2 different data models for community lists:

      - The legacy `community_lists` data model that can be used for compatibility with the existing deployments.
      - The improved `ip_community_lists` data model.

      Both data models can coexist without conflicts, as different keys are used: `community_lists` vs `ip_community_lists`.
      Community list names must be unique.

      The improved data model has a better design documented below:

      communities and regexp MUST not be configured together in the same entry
      possible community strings are (case insensitive):

      - GSHUT
      - internet
      - local-as
      - no-advertise
      - no-export
      - <1-4294967040>
