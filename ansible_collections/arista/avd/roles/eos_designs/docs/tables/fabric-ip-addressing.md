        # This variable defines the Multi-chassis Link Aggregation (MLAG) algorithm used.
        # Each MLAG link will have a /31¹ subnet with each subnet allocated from the relevant MLAG pool via a calculated offset.
        # The offset is calculated using one of the following algorithms:

        #     This allocation method will skip every other /31¹ subnet making it less space efficient than `odd_id`.
        #   - odd_id: `(odd_id - 1) / 2`. Requires the node_group to have a node with an odd ID and a node with an even ID.
