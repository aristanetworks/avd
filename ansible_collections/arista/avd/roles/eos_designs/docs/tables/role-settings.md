    | -------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
    | [<samp>avd_eos_designs_debug</samp>](## "avd_eos_designs_debug") | Boolean |  | `False` |  | Dump all vars and facts per device after generating `avd_switch_facts`. |
    | [<samp>avd_eos_designs_structured_config</samp>](## "avd_eos_designs_structured_config") | Boolean |  | `True` |  | Generate structured configuration per device. |
    | [<samp>avd_eos_designs_unset_facts</samp>](## "avd_eos_designs_unset_facts") | Boolean |  | `True` |  | Unset `avd_switch_facts` to gain a small performance improvement since Ansible needs to handle fewer variables. |

    | [<samp>&nbsp;&nbsp;enable</samp>](## "eos_designs_documentation.enable") | Boolean |  | `True` |  | Generate fabric-wide documentation. |
    | [<samp>&nbsp;&nbsp;connected_endpoints</samp>](## "eos_designs_documentation.connected_endpoints") | Boolean |  | `False` |  | Include connected endpoints in the fabric-wide documentation.<br>This is `false` by default to avoid cluttering documentation for projects with thousands of endpoints. |
    | [<samp>&nbsp;&nbsp;topology_csv</samp>](## "eos_designs_documentation.topology_csv") | Boolean |  | `False` |  | Generate Topology CSV with all interfaces towards other devices. |
    | [<samp>&nbsp;&nbsp;p2p_links_csv</samp>](## "eos_designs_documentation.p2p_links_csv") | Boolean |  | `False` |  | Generate P2P links CSV with all routed point-to-point links between devices. |
