    description: "- Set default uplink, downlink, and MLAG interfaces, which will
      be used if these interfaces are not defined on a device (either directly or
      through inheritance).\n- These are defined based on the combination of node_type
      (e.g., l3leaf or spine) and a regex for matching the platform.\n- A list of
      interfaces or interface ranges can be specified.\n- Each list item supports
      range syntax that can be expanded into a list of interfaces. Interface range
      examples:\n  - Ethernet49-52/1: Expands to [ Ethernet49/1, Ethernet50/1, Ethernet51/1,
      Ethernet52/1 ]\n  - Ethernet1/31-34/1: Expands to [ Ethernet1/31/1, Ethernet1/32/1,
      Ethernet1/33/1, Ethernet1/34/1 ]\n  - Ethernet49-50,53-54: Expands to [ Ethernet49,
      Ethernet50, Ethernet53, Ethernet54 ]\n  - Ethernet1-2/1-4: Expands to [ Ethernet1/1,
      Ethernet1/2, Ethernet1/3, Ethernet1/4, Ethernet2/1, Ethernet2/2, Ethernet2/3,
      Ethernet2/4 ]\n- `uplink_interfaces` and `mlag_interfaces` under `default_interfaces`
      are directly inherited by `uplink_interfaces` and `mlag_interfaces`.\n- `downlink_interfaces`
      are referenced by the child switch (e.g., the leaf in a leaf/spine network).
      The child switch leverages an upstream switch's `default_downlink_interfaces`
      using the child switch ID.  This is then used to build `uplink_switch_interfaces`
      for that child.\n  - In the case of `max_parallel_uplinks` > 1 the `default_downlink_interfaces`
      are mapped with consecutive downlinks per child ID.\n  - Example for `max_parallel_uplinks:
      2`, downlink interfaces will be mapped as `[ <downlink1 to leaf-id1>, <downlink2
      to leaf-id1>, <downlink1 to leaf-id2>, <downlink2 to leaf-id2> ...]`\n- Please
      note that no default interfaces are defined in AVD itself. You will need to
      create your own based on the example below.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\n- types:
      [ spine, l3leaf ]\n  platforms: [ \"7050[SC]X3\", vEOS.*, default ]\n  uplink_interfaces:
      [ Ethernet49-54/1 ]\n  mlag_interfaces: [ Ethernet55-56/1 ]\n  downlink_interfaces:
      [ Ethernet1-32/1 ]\n```\n"
