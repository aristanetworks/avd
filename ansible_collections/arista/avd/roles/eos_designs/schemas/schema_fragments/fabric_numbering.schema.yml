              IDs will be automatically assigned according to the configured algorithm.
              - `static` will use the statically set IDs under node setting.
              - `pool_manager` will activate the pool manager for ID pools.

              Path to file to use for storing ID pool data when using "pool_manager" as algorithm.
              By default the path is "intended/data/<fabric_name>-ids.yml".

              Note: Since the pool manager will remove stale entries after every run, each fabric should be using it's own file.
