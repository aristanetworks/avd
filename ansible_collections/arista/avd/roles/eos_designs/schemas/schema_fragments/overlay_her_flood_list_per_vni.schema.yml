      When using Head-End Replication, configure flood-lists per VNI.
      By default HER will be configured with a common flood-list containing all VTEPs.
      This behavior can be changed to per-VNI flood-lists by setting `overlay_her_flood_list_per_vni: true`.
      This will make `eos_designs` consider configured VLANs per VTEP, and only include the relevant VTEPs to each VNI's flood-list.
    default: false
