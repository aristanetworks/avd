            Insert a default route to the `peer_ip` if `ip` is an ip address
            or configure to accept a default route from DHCP if `ip` is `dhcp`.

            AVD will error out if set to true, `ip` is an ip address and `peer_ip` is missing.

            The WAN Carrier this interface is connected to.
