      When using Head-End Replication, set the scope of flood-lists to Fabric or DC.
      By default all VTEPs in the Fabric (part of the inventory group referenced by "fabric_name") are added to the flood-lists.
      This can be changed to all VTEPs in the DC (part of the inventory group referenced by "dc_name").
      This is useful if Border Leaf switches are dividing the VXLAN overlay into separate domains.
    valid_values:
      - "fabric"
      - "dc"
    default: "fabric"
