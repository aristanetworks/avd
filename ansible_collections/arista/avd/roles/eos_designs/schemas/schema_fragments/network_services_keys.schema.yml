    description: |
      Network Services can be grouped by using separate keys.
      The keys can be customized to provide a better better organization or grouping of your data.
      `network_services_keys` should be defined in the top level group_vars for the fabric.
      The default values will be overridden if defining this key, so it is recommended to copy the defaults and modify them.
