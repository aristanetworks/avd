       Conversion Mode for AVD input data conversion
       During conversion, messages will be generated with information about the host(s) and key(s) which required conversion.
       "disabled" means that conversion will not run - avoid this since conversion is also handling data deprecation and upgrade.
       "error" will produce error messages and fail the task.
       "warning" will produce warning messages.
       "info" will produce regular log messages.
       "debug" will produce hidden debug messages viewable with -v.
       "quiet" will not produce any messages
