            List of ranges using AVD range_expand syntax.
            For example:

            switch_ports:
              - Ethernet1
              - Ethernet2-48

            All switch_ports ranges are expanded into individual port configurations.

            For more details and examples of the `range_expand` syntax, see the [`arista.avd.range_expand` documentation](../../../docs/plugins/Filter%20plugins/range_expand.md).
