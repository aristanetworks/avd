      Configure Virtual Topologies for CV Pathfinder and AutoVPN.

      Auto create a control plane profile/policy/application and enforce it being first in the default VRF.

          By default, if no path-groups are specified, all locally available path-groups

          ID is hardcoded to 254 for the AVT profile in CV Pathfinder mode.

          List of virtual toplogies policies.

          For AutoVPN, each item in the list creates:
            * one policy with:
                * one `match` entry per `application_virtual_topologies` item
                  they are indexed using `10 * <list_index>` where `list_index` starts at `1`.
                * one `default-match`
            * one load-balance policy per `application_virtual_topologies` and one for the `default_virtual_topology`.
            * if the policy is associated with the default VRF, a special control-plane rule is injected
              in the policy with index `1` referring to a control-plane load-balance policy as defined under
              `control_plane_virtual_topology`.


          For CV Pathfinder, each item in the list creates:
            * one policy with:
                * one `match` entry per `application_virtual_topologies` item ordered as in the model.
                * one last match entry for the `default` application-profile using `default_virtual_topology` information.
            * one profile per `application_virtual_topologies` item.
            * one profile for the `default_virtual_topology`..
            * one load-balance policy per `application_virtual_topologies`.
            * one load_balance policy for the `default_virtual_topology`.
            * if the policy is associated with the default VRF, a special control-plane profile is configured
              and injected first in the policy assigned to the `default` VRF. This profile points to a
              control-plane load-balance policy as defined under `control_plane_virtual_topology`.
