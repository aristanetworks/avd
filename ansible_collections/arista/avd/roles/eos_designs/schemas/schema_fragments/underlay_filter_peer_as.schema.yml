      Configure route-map on eBGP sessions towards underlay peers, where prefixes with the peer's ASN in the AS Path are filtered away.
      This is very useful in very large scale networks not using EVPN overlays, where convergence will be quicker by not having to return
      all updates received from Spine-1 to Spine-2 just for Spine-2 to throw them away because of AS Path loop detection.
      Note this key is ignored when EVPN is configured.
