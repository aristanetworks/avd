      Graceful BGP restart allows a BGP speaker with separate control plane and data plane processing to continue forwarding traffic during a BGP restart.
      Its neighbors (receiving speakers) may retain routing information from the restarting speaker while a BGP session with it is being re-established, reducing route flapping.
