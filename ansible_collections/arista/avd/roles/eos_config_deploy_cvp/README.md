# eos_config_deploy_cvp

## Overview

**eos_config_deploy_cvp** is a role that deploys the configuration to Arista EOS devices via the CloudVision Management platform.

The **eos_config_deploy_cvp** role:

- Designed to configure CloudVision with fabric configlets & topology.
- Deploy intended configlets to devices and execute pending tasks.

## Role requirements

This role requires to install `arista.cvp` collection to support CloudVision interactions.

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install arista.cvp
```

> **NOTE**: When using ansible-cvp modules, the user executing the Ansible playbook must have access to both CVP and the EOS CLI.

## Role Inputs and Outputs

Figure 1 below provides a visualization of the role's inputs, outputs, and tasks in order executed by the role.

1. Read inventory
   1. Build containers topology
2. Role looks for configuration previously generated by [`arista.avd.eos_cli_config_gen`](../eos_cli_config_gen/README.md)
   1. List configuration and build configlets list, one per device
3. Role looks for additional configlets to attach to either devices or containers
4. Build CloudVision configuration using [`arista.cvp`](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-cvp/) collection:
   1. Build configlets on CV
   2. Create containers topology
   3. Move devices to container
   4. Bind configlet to device
5. Deploy Fabric configuration by running all pending tasks (optional, if execute_tasks == true)

### Inputs

**Inventory configuration:**

An entry must be part of the inventory to describe the CloudVision server. `arista.cvp` modules use the httpapi approach. The example below provides a framework to use in your inventory.

```yaml
all:
  children:
    cloudvision:
      hosts:
        cv_server01:
          ansible_host: 10.83.28.164
          ansible_user: ansible
          ansible_password: ansible
          ansible_connection: httpapi
          ansible_httpapi_use_ssl: True
          ansible_httpapi_validate_certs: False
          ansible_network_os: eos
          ansible_httpapi_port: 443
```

For a complete list of authentication options available with CloudVision Ansible collection, you can read the dedicated page on [arista.cvp collection](https://cvp.avd.sh/en/latest/docs/how-to/cvp-authentication/).

### Role default output directories

Default output directories can be updated by modifying the default role variables:

``` yaml
--8<--
roles/eos_config_deploy_cvp/defaults/main/output_directories.yml
--8<--
```

!!! tip
    You might need the outputs generated by AVD in a different folder than inventory (the default). If updating `root_dir`, leverage a relative path from `inventory_dir` to ensure consistent behavior. Example: `root_dir: '{{ inventory_dir}}/../outputs'`.

### Role variables

- **`avd_inventory_to_container_file`**: Inventory YAML file to read inventory from. Default is to read from memory.
- **`container_root`**: Inventory group name where fabric devices are located. Default: `{{ fabric_name }}`.
- **`container_apply_mode`**:  `strict` / `loose`. Set how configlets are attached/detached to containers. If set to strict all configlets not listed in your vars will be detached. Default: `loose`.
- **`configlets_prefix`**: Prefix to use for configlet on CV side. Default: `AVD-{{ fabric_name }}-`.
- **`device_filter`**: Filter to target a specific set of devices on CV side. Default: `all`. It can be either a string or a list of strings.
- **`device_apply_mode`**: `strict` / `loose`. Set how configlets are attached/detached on device. If set to strict, all configlets and image bundles not listed in your vars are detached. Default: `loose`.
- **`device_inventory_mode`**: `strict` / `loose`. Define how missing devices are handled. "loose" will ignore missing devices. "strict" will fail on any missing device. Default: `strict`. **NOTE**: This option requires `arista.cvp` collection version >= 3.8.0.
- **`device_search_key`**: `fqdn` / `hostname` / `serialNumber`. Key name to use to look for device in CloudVision. Default: `hostname`.
- **`state`**: `present` / `absent`. Support creation or cleanup topology on CV server. Default: `present`.
- **`execute_tasks`**:  `true` / `false`. Support automatically executing pending tasks. Default: `false`.
- **`cvp_configlets`**: Structure to add additional configlets to those automatically generated by AVD roles.
- **`cv_collection`**: Version of CloudVision collection to use. Can be `v1` or `v3`. Default is `v3`.
- **`avd_eos_config_deploy_cvp_provision`**: Deploy/remove the generated configs and containers on CloudVision. Default: `true`.
- **`avd_eos_config_deploy_cvp_execute_existing_tasks`**: For `cv_collection: v1` only, execute *existing* tasks on CloudVision *before* uploading configlets. Default: `false`.
- **`avd_eos_config_deploy_cvp_execute_configlet_tasks`**: Execute pending tasks on CloudVision after uploading configlets. Default: `false`.
- **`avd_eos_config_deploy_cvp_execute_container_tasks`**: Execute pending tasks on CloudVision after creating containers. Default: `false`.
- **`avd_eos_config_deploy_cvp_execute_device_tasks`**: Execute pending tasks on CloudVision after onboarding, moving or changing devices. Default: `false`.

#### Getting Started

Below is an example of how to use role with a single string as `device_filter`:

```yaml
- name: Deploy Configs
  hosts: CVP
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Run CVP provisioning
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
          name: eos_config_deploy_cvp
      vars:
        container_root: 'DC1_FABRIC'
        configlets_prefix: 'DC1-AVD'
        device_filter: 'DC1'
        state: present
        execute_tasks: false
```

The following code block is an example of how to use this role with a list of strings to create `device_filter` entries:

```yaml
- name: Deploy Configs
  hosts: CVP
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Run CVP provisioning
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
          name: eos_config_deploy_cvp
      vars:
        container_root: 'DC1_FABRIC'
        configlets_prefix: 'DC1-AVD'
        device_filter:
          - 'DC1'
          - 'DC2'
        state: present
        execute_tasks: false
```

#### Ignore devices not provisioned in CloudVision

When you want to provision a complete topology and devices aren't already in CloudVision, you can configure inventory to ignore these devices by using a host variable: `is_deployed`.

- `is_deployed: true` or `is_deployed is not defined`: An entry in **cv_device** is generated and AVD will configure device on CloudVision. If device is undefined, an error is raised.
- `is_deployed: false`: Device isn't configured in **cv_device** topology and only its configlet is uploaded on CloudVision.

Here is an overview with the key configured in the YAML inventory:

```yaml
  DC1_BL1:
    hosts:
      DC1-BL1A:
        ansible_port: 8012
  DC1_BL2:
    hosts:
      DC1-BL2A:
        ansible_port: 8012
        # Device configuration is generated by AVD
        # Device is not configured on Cloudvision (configlet is uploaded)
        is_deployed: false
```

#### Deploy using device serial number as key instead of device hostname

During configuration deployment, devices can be identified using their serial number instead of the hostname.
This avoids the requirement of special DHCP reservations to get the correct hostname assigned for Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP).

To use serial number as the key, each device must have a hostvar `serial_number` set. This can be set as hostvars in the inventory like:

```yaml
  DC1_BL1:
    hosts:
      DC1-BL1A:
        serial_number: ABCDEF0123456789
```

If using `arista.avd.eos_designs`, it is also possible to set `serial_number` under the fabric topology definitions like:

```yaml
spine:
  nodes:
    - name: DC1-SPINE1
      serial_number: ABCDEF0123456789
```

Since `eos_designs` will output the `serial_number` as part of the `structured_config`, this config is only available within the same play as where `eos_designs` was run. If you wish to split Ansible playbooks, you can either add an `include_vars` task
first, to import the `structured_config` file per host, or just set the `serial_number` in the inventory like in the first example above.

To instruct the `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp` role to use the serial number as the identifier of devices, the playbook should be updated with `cv_collection: v3` and `device_search_key: serialNumber` similar to this example:

```yaml
- name: Deploy Configs
  hosts: CVP
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Deploy Configurations to Devices
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
        name: arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp
      vars:
        container_root: 'DC1_FABRIC'
        configlets_prefix: 'DC1-AVD'
        state: present
        execute_tasks: false
        cv_collection: v3
        device_search_key: serialNumber
```

If the `serial_number` variable is not set correctly, an error will be raised:

```sh
TASK [arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp : Build DEVICES and CONTAINER definition for mycvpserver] ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was: ansible.errors.AnsibleError: When using 'device_search_key: serialNumber', on device SPINE1 'serial_number' was expected but not set!
fatal: [mycvpserver -> localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "AnsibleError: When using 'device_search_key: serialNumber', on device SPINE1 'serial_number' was expected but not set!"}
```

#### Add additional configlets

This structure **must** be part of `group_vars` targeting `container_root`. Below is an example applied to `eos_l3_evpn`:

```yaml
# group_vars/DC1_FABRIC.yml

# List of additional CVP configlets to bind to devices and containers
# Configlets MUST be configured on CVP before running AVD playbooks.
cv_configlets:
  containers:
    <name of container>:
      - <First configlet to attach>
      - <Second configlet to attach>
      - <...>
  devices:
    <inventory_hostname>:
      - <First configlet to attach>
      - <Second configlet to attach>
      - <...>
    <inventory_hostname>:
      - <First configlet to attach>
      - <Second configlet to attach>
      - <...>
```

Full example:

```yaml
# group_vars/DC1_FABRIC.yml

# List of additional CVP configlets to bind to devices and containers
# Configlets MUST be configured on CVP before running AVD playbooks.
cv_configlets:
  containers:
    DC1_L3LEAFS:
      - GLOBAL-ALIASES
  devices:
    DC1-L2LEAF2A:
      - GLOBAL-ALIASES
    DC1-L2LEAF2B:
      - GLOBAL-ALIASES
```

*Notes:*

- These configlets **must** be created previously on CloudVision server and won't be managed by AVD roles.
- Current version **doesn't** support configlets unbound from container for safety reason. In such case, configlets should be removed from variables and manually unbind from containers on CloudVision.

#### Run module with different tags

This module also supports tags to run a subset of ansible tasks:

- **`build`**: Generate Arista Validated Designs configuration for EOS devices (structure_configs / configs / documentation) and CloudVision inputs.
- **`provision`**: Run `build` tags + configure CloudVision with information generated in previous tasks

```shell
ansible-playbook playbook.to.deploy.with.cvp.yml --tags "provision"
```

Other option to run a subset of ansible tasks is to use **`--skip-tags <tag>`**:

- To run the module to update existing configlets only, we can use the following command:

```shell
ansible-playbook playbook.to.deploy.with.cvp.yml --skip-tags "containers"
```

- Skipping multiple tags could make the playbook even more lightweight. For example, the command below avoids CVP task execution.

```shell
ansible-playbook playbook.to.deploy.with.cvp.yml --skip-tags "containers,apply"
```

### Outputs

- None.

### Tasks

1. Copy generated configuration to CloudVision static configlets.
2. Create container topology and attach devices to the correct container.
3. Bind configlet for each device.
4. Apply generated tasks to deploy the configuration to devices.
