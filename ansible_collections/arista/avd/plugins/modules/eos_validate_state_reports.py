module: eos_validate_state_reports
version_added: "4.5.0"
author: Arista Ansible Team (@aristanetworks)
short_description: Generates validation reports for the eos_validate_state role
description: |-
  The `arista.avd.eos_validate_state_reports` module is an Ansible Action Plugin designed to generate
  validation reports from the test results produced by the ANTA test framework.

  This plugin requires a JSON file for each host in the Ansible play, containing all test results. The JSON file
  is created automatically by the `eos_validate_state_runner` plugin and is saved in the test results directory
  with the following naming convention `<inventory_hostname>-results.json`.

  The plugin offers the following functionalities:

  - It aggregates all test results from every host in the Ansible play and generates a CSV report.
  - It produces a detailed Markdown report with various sections presenting key statistics derived from the results.
  - The design allows for easy extension to support additional report formats in the future.
options:
  validation_report_csv:
    description: Indicates whether a CSV report should be generated.
    type: bool
    default: true
  validation_report_md:
    description: Indicates whether a Markdown report should be generated.
    type: bool
    default: true
  only_failed_tests:
    description: Determines if the generated reports should include only the failed tests.
    type: bool
    default: false
  csv_report_path:
    description:
      - The absolute path where the CSV report will be saved.
      - Required if `validation_report_csv` is set to `True`.
    type: str
  md_report_path:
    description:
      - The absolute path where the Markdown report will be saved.
      - Required if `validation_report_md` is set to `True`.
    type: str
  test_results_dir:
    description:
    - The directory where the test results JSON file for each host will be saved.
  cprofile_file:
    description:
      - The filename for storing cProfile data, useful for debugging performance issues.
      - Be aware that enabling cProfile can affect performance, so use it only for troubleshooting.

notes:
  - Enabling the cProfile feature for performance profiling may impact the plugin's performance, especially in production environments.
  - Hosts with `is_deployed` is False are automatically skipped, and no test results are processed for these hosts.
