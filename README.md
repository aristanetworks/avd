Arista Validated Designs (AVD) is an extensible data model that defines Arista's Unified Cloud Network architecture as "code".

AVD Documentation:

- [Stable version](https://avd.arista.com/stable/)
- [Development version](https://www.avd.sh/en/devel/)

## Features

- **Flexibility with Open Data Models:** Extensible fabric-wide network models, simplifying configuration, delivering consistency, and reducing errors
- **Simplification through Multi-Domain Automation:** A framework that can automate the data center, campus or wide area network, enabled by a consistent EOS software image and management platform
- **Comprehensive Workflows:** Automating the full life cycle of network provisioning from config generation to pre and post-deployment validation, and self-documentation of the network
