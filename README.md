Arista AVD is an extensible data model that defines Arista's Unified Cloud Network architecture as "code".

AVD Documentation:

- [Stable version](https://avd.arista.com/stable/)
- [Development version](https://avd.arista.com/devel/)

## Support

- AVD is an open-source project maintained by a dedicated Arista engineering team. Customers can purchase TAC support for AVD through the [A-Care Service contract](./docs/support/support_overview.md). TAC support for AVD must be purchased separately.
- Without a support contract AVD code can be used as-is, without any warranty and with best-effort problem resolution via [GitHub discussions board](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/discussions).

## Features

- **Flexibility with Open Data Models:** Extensible fabric-wide network models, simplifying configuration, delivering consistency, and reducing errors
- **Simplification through Multi-Domain Automation:** A framework that can automate the data center, campus or wide area network, enabled by a consistent EOS software image and management platform
- **Comprehensive Workflows:** Automating the full life cycle of network provisioning from config generation to pre- and post-deployment validation, and self-documentation of the network
